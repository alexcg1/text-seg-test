ColBERT’s late interaction scoring approximates the joint query-document attention seen in cross-encoders while maintaining inference efficiency closer to traditional dense retrieval models, thanks to its bi-encoder architecture and recent optimizations in indexing and search. In this paper, we introduce several improvements to the ColBERT model architecture and training pipeline, leveraging techniques successful in the more established single-vector embedding model paradigm, particularly those suited for heterogeneous multilingual data. Our new model, Jina-ColBERT-v2, demonstrates strong performance across a range of English and multilingual retrieval tasks, while also cutting storage requirements by up to 50% compared to previous models. arXiv.org Rohan Jha jina-colbert-v2 jina-colbert-v1-en Original ColBERTv2 Average of 14 English BEIR tasks 0.521 0.494 0.489 Multilingual 89 languages English-only English-only Output dimensions 128, 96, or 64 Fixed 128 Fixed 128 Max query length 32 tokens 32 tokens 32 tokens Max document length 8192 tokens 8192 tokens 512 tokens Parameters 560M 137M 110M Model size 1.1GB 550MB 438MB Asymmetric Embedding in ColBERT ColBERT builds on the BERT architecture by adding late interaction and asymmetric query-document encoding. What is ColBERT and Late Interaction and Why They Matter in Search? Jina AI’s ColBERT on Hugging Face has set Twitter abuzz, bringing a fresh perspective to search with its 8192-token capability. This article unpacks the nuances of ColBERT and ColBERTv2, showcasing their innovative designs and why their late interaction feature is a game-changer for search. The asymmetric nature of ColBERT means that when using models like jina-colbert-v2 or jina-colbert-v1-en, you need to specify whether you are embedding a query, a document, or both (for reranking purposes).

We introduce the \"Late Chunking\" that leverages long-context embedding models to generate contextual chunk embeddings for better retrieval applications. Michael Günther, Han Xiao • 8 minutes read About a year ago, in October 2023, we released the world\\'s first open-source embedding model with an 8K context length, jina-embeddings-v2-base-en. Since then, there has been quite some debate about the usefulness of long-context in embedding models. For many applications, encoding a document thousands of words long into a single embedding representation is not ideal. Many use cases require retrieving smaller portions of the text, and dense vector-based retrieval systems often perform better with smaller text segments, as the semantics are less likely to be \"over-compressed\" in the embedding vectors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the most well-known applications that requires splitting documents into smaller text chunks (say within 512 tokens). These chunks are usually stored in a vector database, with vector representations generated by a text embedding model. During runtime, the same embedding model encodes a query into a vector representation, which is then used to identify relevant stored text chunks. These chunks are subsequently passed to a large language model (LLM), which synthesizes a response to the query based on the retrieved texts. A typical RAG pipeline of chunking-embedding-retrieving-generating. In short, embedding smaller chunks seems to be more preferable, partly due to the limited input sizes of downstream LLMs, but also because there’s a concern that important contextual information in a long context may get diluted when compressed into a single vector. But if the industry only ever needs embedding models with a 512-context length, what’s the point of training models with an 8192-context length at all? In this article, we revisit this important, albeit uncomfortable, question by exploring the limitations of the naive chunking-embedding pipeline in RAG. We introduce a new approach called \"Late Chunking,\" which leverages the rich contextual information provided by 8192-length embedding models to more effectively embed chunks.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2400, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Specifically, this process can destroy long-distance contextual dependencies. In other words, when relevant information is spread across multiple chunks, taking text segments out of context can render them ineffective, making this approach particularly problematic. In the image below, a Wikipedia article is split into chunks of sentences. You can see that phrases like \"its\" and \"the city\" reference \"Berlin,\" which is mentioned only in the first sentence. This makes it harder for the embedding model to link these references to the correct entity, thereby producing a lower-quality vector representation. This means, if we split a long article into sentence-length chunks, as in the example above, a RAG system might struggle to answer a query like \"What is the population of Berlin?\" Because the city name and the population never appear together in a single chunk, and without any larger document context, an LLM presented with one of these chunks cannot resolve anaphoric references like \"it\" or \"the city.\" There are some heuristics to alleviate this issue, such as resampling with a sliding window, using multiple context window lengths, and performing multi-pass document scans. However, like all heuristics, these approaches are hit-or-miss; they may work in some cases, but there\\'s no theoretical guarantee of their effectiveness.

Afterward, an embedding model is repetitively applied to these resulting chunks. To generate a single embedding for each chunk, many embedding models use mean pooling on these token-level embeddings to output a single embedding vector. An illustration of the naive chunking strategy (left) and the late chunking strategy (right). In contrast, the \"Late Chunking\" approach we propose in this article first applies the transformer layer of the embedding model to the entire text or as much of it as possible. This generates a sequence of vector representations for each token that encompasses textual information from the entire text. Subsequently, mean pooling is applied to each chunk of this sequence of token vectors, yielding embeddings for each chunk that consider the entire text\\'s context. Unlike the naive encoding approach, which generates independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) chunk embeddings, late chunking creates a set of chunk embeddings where each one is \"conditioned on\" the previous ones, thereby encoding more contextual information for each chunk. Obviously to effectively apply late chunking, we need long-context embedding models like jina-embeddings-v2-base-en, which support up to 8192 tokens—roughly ten standard pages of text. Text segments of this size are much less likely to have contextual dependencies that require an even longer context to resolve. It\\'s important to highlight that late chunking still requires boundary cues, but these cues are used only after obtaining the token-level embeddings—hence the term \"late\" in its naming.

Cone Effect A model built with a CLIP or CLIP-style architecture is actually two separate embedding models hooked together. For image-text multimodal models, this means one model for encoding texts, and a completely separate one for encoding images, as in the schema below. These two models are trained so that an image embedding and a text embedding are relatively close together when the text does a good job of describing the image. You can train a model like this by randomizing the weights in both models, then presenting image and text pairs to it together, training it from scratch to minimize the distance between the two outputs. The original OpenAI CLIP model was trained this way. However, this requires a lot of image-text pairs and a lot of computationally expensive training. For the first CLIP model, OpenAI scraped 400 million image-text pairs from captioned materials on the Internet. More recent CLIP-style models use pre-trained components. This means training each component separately as a good single-mode embedding model, one for texts and one for images. These two models are then further trained together using image-text pairs, a process called contrastive tuning. Aligned image-text pairs are used to slowly “nudge” the weights into making matching text and image embeddings closer together, and non-matching ones farther apart. This approach generally requires less image-text pair data, which is difficult and costly to obtain, and large amounts of plain texts and images without captions, which are much easier to obtain.

[2024] Figure 2: Initial locations of image and text embeddings before pair training in Jina CLIP, projected into two dimensions. If we take these two pre-trained models and look at their output, before training them with image-text pairs, we notice something important. Figure 2 (above) is a UMAP projection into two dimensions of the image embeddings produced by the pre-trained EVA-02 encoder and the text embeddings produced by the pre-trained JinaBERT v2, with the grey lines indicating matched image-text pairs. This is before any cross-modal training. The result is a sort of truncated “cone”, with image embeddings at one end and text embeddings at the other. This cone-shape is poorly translated to two-dimensional projections but you can broadly see it in the image above. All the texts cluster together in one part of the embedding space, and all the images in another part. If, after training, texts are still more similar to other texts than to matching images, this initial state is a big reason why. The objective of best matching images to texts, texts to texts, and images to images, is completely compatible with this cone shape. The model is prejudiced at birth and what it learns doesn’t change that. Figure 3 (below) is the same analysis of the Jina CLIP model as released, after full training using image-text pairs. If anything, the multimodal gap is even more pronounced. Figure 3: Locations of image and text embeddings after pair training in Jina CLIP, projected into two dimensions. Even after extensive training, Jina CLIP still encodes the medium as part of the message. Using the more expensive OpenAI approach, with purely random initialization, does not get rid of this bias. We took the original OpenAI CLIP architecture and completely randomized all the weights, then did the same analysis as above. The result is still a truncated cone shape, as seen in Figure 4: Figure 4: Initial locations of image and text embeddings in Jina CLIP with completely randomized weights and no training at all, projected into two dimensions. This bias is a structural problem, and may not have any solution. If so, we can only look for ways to correct for it or mitigate it during training. Training Temperature During AI model training, we typically add some randomness to the process. We calculate how much a batch of training samples should change the weights in the model, then add a small random factor to those changes before actually changing the weights. We call the amount of randomness the temperature, by analogy with the way we use randomness in thermodynamics. High temperatures create big changes in models very fast, while low temperatures reduce the amount a model can change each time it sees some training data. The result is that with high temperatures, we can expect individual embeddings to move around a lot in the embedding space during training, and with low temperatures, they will move around much more slowly. Best practice for training AI models is to start with a high temperature and then progressively lower it. This helps the model make big leaps in learning at the beginning when the weights are either random or far from where they need to be and then lets it learn the details more stably. Jina CLIP image-text pair training starts with a temperature of 0.07 (this is a relatively high temperature) and lowers it exponentially over the course of training to 0.01, as shown in Figure 5 below, a graph of temperature vs. training steps: Figure 5: Temperature decay during pair training in Jina CLIP. We wanted to know if raising the temperature — adding randomness — would reduce the cone effect and bring the image embeddings and text embeddings closer together overall. So we retrained Jina CLIP with a fixed temperature of 0.1 (a very high value). After each training epoch, we checked the distribution of distances between image-text pairs and text-text pairs, just like in Figure 1. The results are below in Figure 6: Figure 6: The gap between modalities shrinks with time when the training temperature is high. As you can see, keeping a high temperature does close the multimodal gap dramatically. Allowing the embeddings to move around a lot during training goes a long way to overcoming the initial bias in embedding distribution.

This poses some problems: Our data sources consist entirely of matching pairs. No one would make a database of texts and images that a human has verified are unrelated, nor could you readily construct one by scraping the web or some other unsupervised or semi-supervised technique. Even image-text pairs that superficially seem completely disjoint aren’t necessarily so. We don’t have a theory of semantics that allows us to objectively make such negative judgments. For example, a picture of a cat lying on a porch is not a completely negative match for the text “a man sleeping on a sofa.” Both involve lying on something. We would ideally want to train with image-text pairs that we knew with certainty were related and unrelated, but there is no obvious way to get known unrelated pairs. It’s possible to ask people “Does this sentence describe this picture?” and expect consistent answers. It’s much harder to get consistent answers from asking “Does this sentence have nothing to do with this picture?” Instead, we get unrelated image-text pairs by randomly selecting pictures and texts from our training data, expecting they will practically always be bad matches. How this works in practice is that we divide our training data into batches. To train Jina CLIP, we used batches containing 32,000 matching image-text pairs, but for this experiment, batch sizes were only 16. The table below is 16 randomly sampled image-text pairs from Flickr8k: To get non-matching pairs, we combine every picture in the batch with every text other than the one it matches.

This isn’t always true. For example: Caption: The dog sits by a snowdrift. Although the text doesn’t describe this image, they do have a dog in common.

The multimodality gap offers us a unique opportunity to study a class of emergent semantic phenomena in AI models. No one told Jina CLIP to encode the medium of the data it was trained on — it just did anyway. Even if we haven't solved the problem for multimodal models, we at least have a good theoretical understanding of where the problem comes from. We should assume that our models are encoding other things we haven’t looked for yet due to the same kind of bias. For example, we likely have the same problem in multilingual embedding models. Co-training on two or more languages probably leads to the same gap between languages, especially since similar training methods are widely used. Solutions to the gap problem may have very broad implications.

Is scraping problematic? Yes. It it legal? Also yes. Web scraping is legal in the US, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Canada. No country appears to have laws specifically addressing this practice, but courts around the world generally agree that it’s legal to use automation to visit websites that are open for anyone to see, and to make private copies of their content. People sometimes believe that by placing some printed notice on a web page or in a robots.txt file, they can forbid scraping or other legal uses of their website and its contents. This doesn’t really work. Notices like that have no legal meaning, and robots.txt is an IETF convention that has no force of law. Without some act of confirmation, at a minimum clicking the button marked “I accept the Terms of Service”, you cannot impose conditions on visitors to your website, and even then they are often legally unenforceable. Your Website Terms of Service are Unenforceable | Insights | Venable LLP Venable LLP Joshua J. Kaufman However, while scraping is legal, there are some limitations: Practices that might reduce the usability of a website for others, like hitting it too often or too fast with your web-scraper, may have civil or even criminal consequences in extreme cases. Many countries have laws that criminalize accessing computers in unauthorized ways. If there are parts of a website that are clearly not meant to be accessed by the general public, it may be illegal to scrape them. Many countries have laws that make it illegal to circumvent anti-copying technologies. If a website has put in place measures to prevent you from downloading some content, you may be breaking the law if you scrape it anyway. Websites that have explicit terms of service, and require you to confirm your acceptance of them, can forbid scraping and take you to court if you do it, but the results are spotty. In the US, there is no explicit law regarding scraping, but efforts to use the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to forbid it have failed, most recently in the Ninth Circuit case hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn in 2019. US law is complex, with a lot of court-made distinctions and a system of state and federal circuit jurisdictions that mean that unless the Supreme Court rules on something, it’s not necessarily final. (And sometimes isn’t final even then.) The EU doesn’t have any specific laws addressing scraping either, but it has been a common and unchallenged practice for a very long time. The Text and Data Mining clause in the 2019 EU Copyright Directive strongly implies that scraping is generally legal. The biggest legal problems are not with the act of scraping but with what happens after you scrape. Copyright still applies to the data you scrape from the web. You can keep a personal copy, but you can’t redistribute or resell it, not without some potential for legal problems.

Probably. A web scrape will, in almost all realistic cases, include copyrighted content. The real question is: Can you use copyrighted content to train an AI without permission from the owner? There are a lot of individual legal points that aren’t fully resolved, but: In Europe, Article 4 of the EU Copyright Directive of 2019 appears to make it legal with some caveats. In Japan, Article 30(4) of the Copyright Law, as amended in 2018, has been interpreted as allowing copyrighted works to be used to train AI without permission. In the US, no law specifically addresses this situation, however, it has been taken for granted for many years that statistical analysis of copyrighted materials is legal, even when the result is a commercial product. Although the lawsuits Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google, Inc. and Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust don’t specifically address AI, they expand the scope of “fair use” under US law so broadly that it is hard to see how AI training could be illegal. The American legal system does not offer an explicit answer and several cases testing this conclusion are making their way through the courts. A number of smaller jurisdictions have also determined that it’s legal, and to the best of my knowledge, none have found it to be illegal to date. European copyright law lets owners of copyrighted data restrict the use of their works for AI training by indicating this “in an appropriate manner”. There is currently no guidance on how they should do this. Japanese copyright law limits the use of copyrighted materials where it might “unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner”. This typically indicates that a copyright holder would have to show how a specific AI model reduces the economic value of their work to be able to make a case. We should note that Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Adobe, and Shutterstock have offered to indemnify any user of their generative AI products who faces a legal challenge on copyright grounds. This is a strong indication that their lawyers think what they are doing is legal under US law. What Voracious Scraping Means For AI The AI scraping bonanza is turning the web into a digital Wild West. These scrapers are treating robots.txt like it\\'s yesterday\\'s news, hammering websites like iFixit with endless requests. It\\'s not just annoying - it\\'s potentially web-breaking stuff that\\'s forcing us to rethink how the open internet works. Or how it might not work in the near future. Just from an economic and social point of view, there are so many things that could change: Trust breakdown: This AI feeding frenzy could lead to a massive trust breakdown across the web. Imagine a future where every website greets you with a skeptical eye, forcing you to prove you\\'re human before you can even peek at their content. We\\'re talking more CAPTCHAs, more login walls, more \"click all the traffic lights\" tests. It\\'s like trying to get into a speakeasy, but instead of a secret password, you need to convince the doorman you\\'re not a very clever machine. Limited human-generated content: Content creators, already wary of their work being swiped, are starting to batten down the hatches. We could see a surge in paywalls, subscriber-only sections, and content locks. The days of freely browsing and learning might become a nostalgic memory, like dial-up modem sounds or AIM away messages. If ordinary humans can’t access it, that makes it all the harder for a rogue scraper to get in. Legal cases: It may be years or even decades before all the legal issues surrounding AI are worked out. We’ve had the Internet for about thirty years, and some of its legal issues are still up in the air today. Whether you’re in the right or not, if you can’t afford to spend years in court finding out what is and isn’t allowed, you have something to worry about. Small fries go broke, fat cats get fatter: This scraping frenzy isn\\'t just a nuisance - it\\'s putting real strain on web infrastructure.

The bouncer will show you the door. AI-Generated Data To The Rescue? The data grab isn\\'t just shaking up websites - it\\'s setting the stage for a potential AI knowledge drought. As the open web pulls up its drawbridges, AI models will find themselves starving for fresh, high-quality data. This data scarcity could lead to a nasty case of AI tunnel vision. Without a steady stream of new information, AI models risk becoming echo chambers of outdated knowledge. Imagine asking an AI about current events and getting answers that sound like they\\'re from last year - or worse, from a parallel universe where facts took a vacation. If human-generated data is locked away, companies still have to get their training data from somewhere. One example of this is synthetic data: Data created by LLMs to train other LLMs. This includes widely used techniques like model distillation and generating training data to compensate for bias. When AI Makes AI: Synthetic Data, Model Distillation, And Model Collapse AI creating AI! Is it the end of the world? Or just another tool to make models do value-adding work? Let’s find out! Using synthetic data means not having to jump through hoops to license human-generated data, which as we’ve seen is getting increasingly difficult. It also helps balance things out - a lot of data on the internet doesn’t represent the diversity of the real world. Generating synthetic data can help make a model more representative of reality (or sometimes not). Finally, for the health and legal use cases, synthetic data eliminates the need to sanitize data to remove personally-identifiable information. However, the flip side of the coin is that future models will also be trained on AI-generated data you really don’t want to be training them on, namely “Slop”: low-quality AI-generated data, like a once-loved tech blog now publishing low-value AI-generated articles under the names of its old staff, AI-generated recipes for unlikely dishes like crockpot mojitos and bratwurst ice cream, or Shrimp Jesus taking over Facebook. Since this is much cheaper and easier to create than good old-fashioned hand-crafted content, it’s rapidly flooding the internet. Based on what we’re seeing today, AI-generated content is overtaking available human-generated content. GPT-5 will be trained (in part) on data created by GPT-4. GPT-6, in turn, will be trained on data created by GPT-5. And so on, and so on. Model Collapse, and How to Avoid It Using your own outputs as inputs is bad for both humans and LLMs. Even if you’re very selective about how much synthetic data you use and what kind, you can’t guarantee that your model won’t get worse For generative AI models as a whole, the drop-off in quality and diversity of output is experimentally measurable and happens pretty fast. Image-generating models develop anomalies after a few generations, and in one paper, a large language model trained on Wikipedia data that gave coherent and accurate responses to prompts was, by the ninth generation of training on its own output, responding to prompts by repeating the words “tailed jackrabbits” over and over. AI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data - Nature &nbsp;Analysis shows that indiscriminately training generative artificial intelligence on real and generated content, usually done by scraping data from&nbsp;the Internet, can lead to a collapse in the ability of the models to generate diverse high-quality output. Nature Ilia Shumailov This is easy enough to explain: An AI model is an approximation of its training data. An AI model trained on AI model output is an approximation of an approximation.

Nature Ilia Shumailov This is easy enough to explain: An AI model is an approximation of its training data. An AI model trained on AI model output is an approximation of an approximation. At each training cycle, the difference between the approximation and the “true” real-world data gets bigger and bigger. We call this “model collapse”. As AI-generated data becomes more and more widespread, training new models from data scraped from the Internet risks lowering model performance. We have some reason to think that as long as the amount of real, human-made data doesn’t decline, our models won’t get much worse, but they won’t get better either. However, they will take longer to train if we can’t separate the AI-made data from human-made data. New models will get costlier to make, without improving. Is Model Collapse Inevitable? Breaking the Curse of Recursion by Accumulating Real and Synthetic Data The proliferation of generative models, combined with pretraining on web-scale data, raises a timely question: what happens when these models are trained on their own generated outputs? Recent investigations into model-data feedback loops proposed that such loops would lead to a phenomenon termed model collapse, under which performance progressively degrades with each model-data feedback iteration until fitted models become useless. However, those studies largely assumed that new data replace old data over time, where an arguably more realistic assumption is that data accumulate over time. In this paper, we ask: what effect does accumulating data have on model collapse? We empirically study this question by pretraining sequences of language models on text corpora. We confirm that replacing the original real data by each generation’s synthetic data does indeed tend towards model collapse, then demonstrate that accumulating the successive generations of synthetic data alongside the original real data avoids model collapse; these results hold across a range of model sizes, architectures, and hyperparameters. We obtain similar results for deep generative models on other types of real data: diffusion models for molecule conformation generation and variational autoencoders for image generation. To understand why accumulating data can avoid model collapse, we use an analytically tractable framework introduced by prior work in which a sequence of linear models are fit to the previous models’ outputs. Previous work used this framework to show that if data are replaced, the test error increases with the number of model-fitting iterations; we extend this argument to prove that if data instead accumulate, the test error has a finite upper bound independent of the number of iterations, meaning model collapse no longer occurs. arXiv.org Matthias Gerstgrasser The irony is thick here. AI's voracious appetite for data might lead to a data famine. Model Autophagy Disorder is like Mad Cow Disease for AI: Just like feeding beef waste to cows led to a new kind of parasitic brain disease, training AI from growing amounts of AI output leads to devastating mental pathologies. Self-Consuming Generative Models Go MAD Seismic advances in generative AI algorithms for imagery, text, and other data types has led to the temptation to use synthetic data to train next-generation models. Repeating this process creates an autophagous (self-consuming) loop whose properties are poorly understood. We conduct a thorough analytical and empirical analysis using state-of-the-art generative image models of three families of autophagous loops that differ in how fixed or fresh real training data is available through the generations of training and in whether the samples from previous generation models have been biased to trade off data quality versus diversity. Our primary conclusion across all scenarios is that without enough fresh real data in each generation of an autophagous loop, future generative models are doomed to have their quality (precision) or diversity (recall) progressively decrease. We term this condition Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), making analogy to mad cow disease. arXiv.org Sina Alemohammad The good news is that AI can’t afford to replace humanity because it needs our data. The bad news is that it may stunt its own growth by ruining its data sources. To avoid this foreseeable AI knowledge famine, we need to rethink how we train and use AI models. We’re already seeing solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which tries to avoid using AI models as a source of factual information and sees them instead as devices for evaluating and reorganizing external information sources.

We could replace purported general-purpose models like ChatGPT with specialist AIs: LawLLM, MedLLM, MyLittlePonyLLM, and so on. There are other possibilities, and it’s hard to say what new techniques researchers will discover. Maybe there's a better way to generate synthetic data or ways to get better models out of less data. But there is no guarantee that more research will solve the problem. In the end, this challenge might force the AI community to get creative. After all, necessity is the mother of invention, and a data-starved AI landscape could spark some truly innovative solutions. Who knows? The next big breakthrough in AI might come not from more data, but from figuring out how to do more with less. What Happens If Only Megacorps Can Afford to Scrape? For many people today, the internet is Facebook, Instagram, and X, viewed through a black glass rectangle they hold in their hand. It’s homogenized, “safe”, and controlled by gatekeepers who decide (via policies and their algorithms) what (and who) you see and what you don’t. It wasn’t always like this. Just a couple of decades ago we had user-generated blogs, independent websites, and much more. In the eighties, there were dozens of operating systems and hardware standards competing. But by the 2010s, Apple and Microsoft had won the day, beginning the trend of homogenization. We see the same thing with web browsers, smartphones, and social media sites. We start off with a burst of diversity and new ideas before the big players hog the ball and make it difficult for anyone else to ply. That said, while those players did have a monopoly, some smaller fry snuck in anyway. (Take Linux and Firefox, for example). “Underdog makes good” is unlikely to happen with LLMs though. When small players lack the financial clout to get access to varied and up-to-date training data, they can’t create high-quality models. And without that, how can they stay in business? The giants have got the resources to keep their AI models gorging on a steady diet of fresh information, even as the wider web tightens its belt. Meanwhile, smaller players and startups are left scraping the bottom of the data barrel, struggling to nourish their algorithms with stale crumbs. It's a knowledge gap that could snowball. As the data-rich get richer in insights and capabilities, the data-poor risk falling further behind, their AIs growing more outdated and less competitive by the day. This isn't just about who has the shiniest AI toys - it's about who gets to shape the future of technology, commerce, and even how we access information. We're looking at a future where a handful of tech behemoths might hold the keys to the most advanced AI kingdoms, while everyone else is left peering in from the digital dark ages.

While available human-generated data dwindles, AI-generated “slop” is booming. Training models on this can lead to a slowdown in improvement or even model collapse. The only way to fix it is by thinking outside the box - something startups, with their culture of innovation and disruption are ideally suited for. Yet, the very data that is being licensed only to the big players is the very lifeblood such startups need to survive.

Like our embedding models, they use the JinaBERT architecture, a variant of the BERT architecture enhanced with a symmetric bidirectional variant of ALiBi. This architecture enables support for long text sequences, with our models accepting up to 8,192 tokens, ideal for deep analysis of larger documents and complex queries requiring detailed language understanding. The Turbo and Tiny models draw on insights gained from Jina Reranker v1. Reranking can be a major bottleneck for information retrieval applications. Traditional search applications are a very mature technology whose performance is well-understood. Rerankers add a great deal of precision to text-based retrieval, but AI models are large and can be slow and expensive to run. Many users would prefer a smaller, faster, cheaper model, even if it comes at some cost to accuracy. Having a single goal – reranking search results – makes it possible to streamline the model and bring users competitive performance in much more compact models. By using fewer hidden layers, we speed up processing and reduce model size. These models cost less to run, and the greater speed makes them more useful for applications that can\\'t tolerate much latency, while retaining nearly all of the performance of larger models. In this article, we\\'ll show you the architecture of Reranker Turbo and Reranker Tiny, measure its performance, and show you how to get started with them. Streamlined Architecture Jine Reranker Turbo (jina-reranker-v1-turbo-en) uses a six-layer architecture, with a total of 37.8 million parameters, in contrast to the 137 million parameters and twelve layers of the base reranker model jina-reranker-v1-base-en. This represents a reduction in model size of three-quarters and as much as a tripling of processing speed. Reranker Tiny (jina-reranker-v1-tiny-en) uses four layers with 33 million parameters, providing even greater parallel processing and faster speeds – almost five times as fast as the base Reranker model – while saving 13% of memory costs over the Turbo model. Document throughput for Jina Reranker models Knowledge Distillation We\\'ve trained Reranker Turbo and Tiny using knowledge distillation. This is a technique for using an existing AI model to train another one to match its behavior. Instead of using external data sources, we use an existing model to generate data for training. We used the Jina Reranker base model to rank collections of documents and then used those results to train both Turbo and Tiny. This way, we can bring much more data into the training process because we aren\\'t limited by available real-world data. This is a bit like a student learning from a teacher: The already trained, high-performance model – the Jina Reranker Base model – \"teaches\" the untrained Jina Turbo and Jina Tiny models by generating new training data. This technique is widely used to create small models from large ones. At its best, the difference in task performance between the \"teacher\" model and the \"student\" can be very small. Evaluation on BEIR The benefits of streamlining and knowledge distillation come at relatively little cost to performance quality. On the BEIR benchmark for information retrieval, jina-reranker-v1-turbo-en scores just under 95% of the accuracy of jina-reranker-v1-base-en, and jina-reranker-v1-tiny-en scores 92.5% of the base model\\'s score. All Jina Reranker models are competitive with other popular reranker models, most of which have much larger sizes.

LlamaIndex RAG Benchmark: Throughput (x-axis) vs Hit Rate (y-axis)(Note that the y-axis is not on the origin. We start with a higher hit rate value to enhance the readability of the graph.) Cost Savings on AWS Using Reranker Turbo and Reranker Tiny provides large savings for AWS and Azure users who pay for memory usage and CPU time. Although the degree of savings varies for different use cases, the roughly 75% reduction in memory usage alone directly corresponds to a 75% savings for cloud systems charging for memory. Furthermore, the faster throughput means that you can run more queries on cheaper AWS instances.

In Haystack 2.0 retrievers are tightly coupled to DocumentStores. If we pass the document store in the retriever we initialized earlier, this pipeline can access the documents we generated, and pass them to the reranker. The reranker then compares these documents directly with the question and ranks them based on relevance. We first define the custom cleaner to remove retrieve tickets that contain either the same issue ID or parent ID as the issue passed as query: from typing import Optional @component class RemoveRelated: @component.output_types(documents=List[Document]) def run(self, tickets: List[Document], query_id: Optional[str]): retrieved_tickets = [] for t in tickets: if not t.meta[\\'Issue id\\'] == query_id and not t.meta[\\'Parent id\\'] == query_id: retrieved_tickets.append(t) return {\\'documents\\': retrieved_tickets} We then embed the query, retrieve relevant documents, clean the selection, and finally rerank it: from haystack_integrations.components.embedders.jina import JinaTextEmbedder from haystack_integrations.components.rankers.jina import JinaRanker query_pipeline_reranker = Pipeline() query_pipeline_reranker.add_component(\\'query_embedder_reranker\\', JinaTextEmbedder(model=\\'jina-embeddings-v2-base-en\\')) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component(\\'query_retriever_reranker\\', retriever_reranker) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component(\\'query_cleaner_reranker\\', RemoveRelated()) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component(\\'query_ranker_reranker\\', JinaRanker()) query_pipeline_reranker.connect(\\'query_embedder_reranker.embedding\\', \\'query_retriever_reranker.query_embedding\\') query_pipeline_reranker.connect(\\'query_retriever_reranker\\', \\'query_cleaner_reranker\\') query_pipeline_reranker.connect(\\'query_cleaner_reranker\\', \\'query_ranker_reranker\\') To highlight the difference caused by the reranker, we analyzed the same pipeline without the final reranking step (the corresponding code was omitted in this post for the sake of readability but can be found in the notebook): To compare the results of these two pipelines, we now define our query in the form of an existing ticket, here \"ZOOKEEPER-3282\": query_ticket_key = \\'ZOOKEEPER-3282\\' with open(\\'tickets.json\\', \\'r\\') as file: tickets = json.load(file) for ticket in tickets: if ticket[\\'Issue key\\'] == query_ticket_key: query = str(ticket) query_ticket_id = ticket[\\'Issue id\\'] It concerns \"a big refactor for the documetations\" [sic]. You\\'ll see that, despite the misspelling, Jina Reranker will correctly retrieve similar tickets. { \"Summary\": \"a big refactor for the documetations\" \"Issue key\": \"ZOOKEEPER-3282\" \"Issue id:: 13216608 \"Parent id\": \"\" \"Issue Type\": \"Task\" \"Status\": \"In Progress\" \"Project lead\": \"phunt\" \"Priority\": \"Major\" \"Assignee\": \"maoling\" \"Reporter\": \"maoling\" \"Creator\": \"maoling\" \"Created\": \"19/Feb/19 11:50\" \"Updated\": \"04/Aug/19 12:48\" \"Last Viewed\": \"12/Mar/24 11:56\" \"Description\": \"Hi guys: I\\'am working on doing a big refactor for the documetations.it aims to - 1.make a better reading experiences and help users know more about zookeeper quickly,as good as other projects\\' doc(e.g redis,hbase). - 2.have less changes to diff with the original docs as far as possible. - 3.solve the problem when we have some new features or improvements,but cannot find a good place to doc it.

The results above clearly show the necessity for both Jina Embeddings to retrieve relevant documents through vector search, and Jina Reranker to finally obtain the most relevant content. If we take, for example, the two issues that relate to adding documentation, i.e. \"ZOOKEEPER-3585\" and \"ZOOKEEPER-3587\", we see that after the retrieval step, they are both correctly included in positions 11 and 9 respectively. After reranking the documents, they are now both within the top 5 most relevant documents at positions 5 and 1 respectively, showing a significant improvement. By integrating both models in Haystack\\'s pipelines, the entire tool is ready for use. This combination makes the Jina Haystack extension the perfect solution for your application.

What I Like About DSPy DSPy Closing the Loop of Prompt Engineering What excites me most about DSPy is its approach to closing the loop of the prompt engineering cycle, transforming what is often a manual, handcrafted process into a structured, well-defined machine learning workflow: i.e. preparing datasets, defining the model, training, evaluating, and testing. In my opinion, this is the most revolutionary aspect of DSPy. Traveling in the Bay Area and talking to a lot of startup founders focused on LLM evaluation, I\\'ve encountered frequent discussions about metrics, hallucinations, observability, and compliance. However, these conversations often don\\'t progress to the critical next steps: With all these metrics in hand, what do we do next? Can tweaking the phrasing in our prompts, in hopes that certain magic words (e.g., \"my grandma is dying\") might boost our metrics, be considered a strategic approach? This question has remained unanswered by many LLM evaluation startups, and it was one I couldn\\'t tackle either—until I discovered DSPy.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1170, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Harrison, the CEO of LangChain, and Logan, the former OpenAI Head of Developer Relations, have both stated on the Unsupervised Learning Podcast that 2024 is expected to be a pivotal year for LLM evaluation. It is for this reason that I believe DSPy deserves more attention than it is right now, as DSPy provides the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. DSPy Separating Logic From Textual Representation Another aspect of DSPy that impresses me is that, it formulates prompt engineering into a reproducible and LLM-agnostic module. To achieve that, it pulls the logic from the prompt, creating a clear separation of concerns between the logic and the textual representation, as illustrated below. In DSPy, Prompt consists of the intrinsic logic (i.e. dspy.Module,) and its textual representation. Logic is immutable, reproducible, testable and LLM-agnostic. Textual representation is just the consequence of the logic. DSPy\\'s concept of logic as the immutable, testable, and LLM-agnostic \"cause\", with textual representation merely as its \"consequence\", may initially seem perplexing. This is especially true in light of the widespread belief, that \"the future of programming language is natural language.\" Embracing the idea that \"prompt engineering is the future,\" one might experience a moment of confusion upon encountering DSPy\\'s design philosophy. Contrary to the expectation of simplification, DSPy introduces an array of modules and signature syntaxes, seemingly regressing natural language prompting to the complexity of C programming! But why take this approach? My understanding is that at the heart of prompt programming lies the core logic, with communication serving as an amplifier, potentially enhancing or diminishing its effectiveness. The directive \"Do sentiment classification\" represents the core logic, whereas phrase like \"Follow these demonstrations or I will fire you\" is one way to communicate it. Analogous to real-life interactions, difficulties in getting things done often stem not from flawed logic but from problematic communications. This explains why many, particularly non-native speakers, find prompt engineering challenging. I\\'ve observed highly competent software engineers in my company struggle with prompt engineering, not due to a lack of logics, but because they do not \"speak the vibe.\" By separating the logic from the prompt, DSPy enables deterministic programming of logic via dspy.Module, allowing developers to shift focus to logic in the same way they would in traditional engineering, irrespective of the LLM used. So, if developers focus on the logic who then manages the textual representation? DSPy takes on this role, utilizing your data and evaluation metrics to refine the textual representation—everything from determining the narrative focus to optimizing hints, and choosing good demonstrations. Remarkably, DSPy can even use evaluation metrics to fine-tune the LLM weights! To me, DSPy\\'s key contributions—closing the loop of training and evaluation in prompt engineering and separating logic from textual representation—underscore its potential significance to LLM/Agent systems.

My aim is to share these insights in the hope that they might clarify similar challenges for other learners. What are teleprompter, optimization, and compile? What\\'s exactly being optimized in DSPy? In DSPy, \"Teleprompters\" is the optimizer, (and looks like @lateinteraction is revamping the docs and code to clarify this). The compile function acts at the heart of this optimizer, akin to calling optimizer.optimize(). Think of it as the DSPy equivalent of training. This compile() process aims to tune: the few-shot demonstrations, the instructions, the LLM\\'s weights However, most beginner DSPy tutorials won\\'t delve into weights and instruction tuning, leading to the next question. What\\'s bootstrap in DSPy all about? Bootstrap refers to the creation of self-generated demonstrations for few-shot in-context learning, a crucial part of the compile() process (i.e., optimization/training as I mentioned above). These few-shot demos are generated from user-given labeled data; and one demo often consists of input, output, rationale (e.g., in Chains of Thought), and intermediate inputs & outputs (for multi-stage prompts). Of course, quality few-shot demos are key to the output excellence. To that, DSPy allows user-defined metric functions to ensure only demos that meet certain criteria are chosen, leading to the next question. What\\'s DSPy metric function? After hands-on experience with DSPy, I\\'ve come to believe that the metric function needs far more emphasis than what the current documentation provides. The metric function in DSPy plays a crucial role in both evaluation and training phases, acting as a \"loss\" function as well, thanks to its implicit nature (controlled by trace=None): def keywords_match_jaccard_metric(example, pred, trace=None): # Jaccard similarity between example keywords and predicted keywords A = set(normalize_text(example.keywords).split()) B = set(normalize_text(pred.keywords).split()) j = len(A & B) / len(A | B) if trace is not None: # act as a \"loss\" function return j return j > 0.8 # act as evaluation This approach differs significantly from traditional machine learning, where the loss function is usually continuous and differentiable (e.g., hinge/MSE), while the evaluation metric might be entirely different and discrete (e.g., NDCG). In DSPy, the evaluation and loss functions are unified in the metric function, which can be discrete and most often returns a boolean value. The metric function can also integrate an LLM! In the example below, I implemented a fuzzy match using LLM to determine if the predicted value and the gold standard answer are similar in magnitude, e.g., \"1 million dollars\" and \"$1M\" would return true. class Assess(dspy.Signature): \"\"\"Assess the if the prediction is in the same magnitude to the gold answer.\"\"\" gold_answer = dspy.InputField(desc=\\'number, could be in natural language\\') prediction = dspy.InputField(desc=\\'number, could be in natural language\\') assessment = dspy.OutputField(desc=\\'yes or no, focus on the number magnitude, not the unit or exact value or wording\\') def same_magnitude_correct(example, pred, trace=None): return dspy.Predict(Assess)(gold_answer=example.answer, prediction=pred.answer).assessment.lower() == \\'yes\\' As powerful as it is, the metric function significantly influences the DSPy user experience, determining not only the final quality assessment but also affecting the optimization results. A well-designed metric function can lead to optimized prompts, whereas a poorly crafted one can cause the optimization to fail. When tackling a new problem with DSPy, you may find yourself spending as much time designing the logic (i.e., DSPy.Module) as you do on the metric function. This dual focus on logic and metrics can be daunting for newcomers. \"Bootstrapped 0 full traces after 20 examples in round 0\" what does this mean?

Your Logic (DSPy.Module) is Incorrect If the metric function is correct, then you need to check if your logic dspy.Module is correctly implemented. First, verify that the DSPy signature is correctly assigned for each step. Inline signatures, such as dspy.Predict(\\'question->answer\\'), are easy to use, but for quality\\'s sake, I strongly suggest implementing with class-based signatures. Specifically, add some descriptive docstrings to the class, fill in desc fields for InputField and OutputField—these all provide the LM with hints about each field.

Your Problem is Just Too Hard If both the metric and module seem correct, then it's possible your problem is just too challenging and the logic you implemented is not enough for solving it. Therefore, DSPy finds it is infeasible to bootstrap any demo given your logic and metric function. At this point, here are some options you can consider: Use a more powerful LM. For example, replacing gpt-35-turbo-instruct with gpt-4-turbo as the student's LM, use a stronger LM as the teacher. This can be often quite effective. After all, a stronger model means better comprehension on the prompts. Improve your logic. Add or replace some steps in your dspy.Module with more complicated ones. e.g., replace Predict to ChainOfThought ProgramOfThought, adding Retrieval step.

For instance, I tackled a particularly challenging problem: generating an SVG icon similar to Google Material Design icons based on two or three keywords. My initial strategy was to utilize a simple DSPy.Module that uses dspy.ChainOfThought(\\'keywords -> svg\\'), paired with a metric function that assessed visual similarity between the generated SVG and the ground truth Material Design SVG, similar to a pHash algorithm. I began with 20 training examples, but after the first round, I ended up with \"Bootstrapped 0 full traces after 20 examples in round 0\", indicating that the optimization had failed. By increasing the dataset to 100 examples, revising my module to incorporate multiple stages, and adjusting the threshold of the metric function, I eventually achieved 2 bootstrapped demonstrations and managed to obtain some optimized prompts.

You can also follow along with a Python Notebook, which you can download or run on Google Colab. Retrieval-Augmented Generation Retrieval-augmented generation is an alternative paradigm in generative AI. Instead of using large language models (LLMs) to directly answer user requests with what it’s learned in training, it takes advantage of their fluent language production while relocating logic and information retrieval to an external apparatus better suited to it. Before invoking an LLM, RAG systems actively retrieve relevant information from some external data source and then feed it to the LLM as part of its prompt. The role of the LLM is to synthesize outside information into a coherent response to user requests, minimizing the risk of hallucination and increasing the relevance and usefulness of the result. A RAG system schematically has at least four components: A data source, typically a vector database of some kind, suited to AI-assisted information retrieval. An information retrieval system that treats the user’s request as a query, and retrieves data that is relevant to answering it. A system, often including an AI-based reranker, that selects some of the retrieved data and processes it into a prompt for an LLM. An LLM, for example one of the GPT models or an open-source LLM like Mistral’s, that takes the user request and the data provided to it and generates a response for the user. Embedding models are well-suited for information retrieval and are often used for that purpose. A text embedding model takes texts as inputs and outputs an embedding — a high-dimensional vector — whose spatial relationship to other embeddings is indicative of their semantic similarity, i.e. similar topics, contents, and related meanings. They are often used in information retrieval because the closer the embeddings, the more likely the user will be happy with the response. They are also relatively easy to fine-tune to improve their performance in specific domains. Text reranker models use similar AI principles to compare collections of texts to a query and sort them by their semantic similarity. Using a task-specific reranker model, instead of relying on just an embedding model, often dramatically increases the precision of search results. The reranker in a RAG application selects some of the results of information retrieval in order to maximize the probability that the right information is in the prompt to the LLM.

Benchmarking Performance of Embedding Models as SageMaker Endpoints We tested the performance and reliability of the Jina Embeddings v2 Base - English model as a SageMaker endpoint, running on a g4dn.xlarge instance. In these experiments, we continuously spawned one new user every second, each of whom would send a request, wait for its response, and repeat upon receiving it. For requests of less than 100 tokens, for up to 150 concurrent users, the response times per request stayed below 100ms. Then, the response times increased linearly from 100ms to 1500ms with the spawning of more concurrent users. At about 300 concurrent users, we received more than 5 failures from the API and ended the test. For requests between 1K and 8K tokens, for up to 20 concurrent users, the response times per request stayed below 8s. Then, the response times increased linearly from 8s to 60s with the spawning of more concurrent users. At about 140 concurrent users, we received more than 5 failures from the API and ended the test. Performance during test runs (left: small context, right: large context), showing the effect of increasing users over time on response times and failure rates. Based on these results, we can conclude that for most users with normal embedding workloads g4dn.xlarge or g5.xlarge instances should meet their daily needs. However, for large indexing jobs, which are typically executed far less often than search tasks, users might prefer a more performant option.

Each row of the file contains: The video title The video URL on YouTube A text transcript of the video To load this data in Python, first install pandas and requests: pip install requests pandas Load the CSV data directly into a Pandas DataFrame named tu_delft_dataframe: import pandas # Load the CSV file tu_delft_dataframe = pandas.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jina-ai/workshops/feat-sagemaker-post/notebooks/embeddings/sagemaker/tu_delft.csv\") You can inspect the contents using the DataFrame\\'s head() method.

You will be billed by the hour until you stop this instance. To do so, follow the instructions in the section Shutting Down. Build and Index the Dataset Now that we have loaded the data and are running a Jina Embeddings v2 model, we can prepare and index the data. We will store the data in a FAISS vector store, an open-source vector database specifically designed for AI applications. First, install the remaining prerequisites for our RAG application: pip install tdqm numpy faiss-cpu Chunking We will need to take the individual transcripts and split them up into smaller parts, i.e., “chunks,” so that we can fit multiple texts into a prompt for the LLM. The code below breaks the individual transcripts up on sentence boundaries, ensuring that all chunks have no more than 128 words by default. def chunk_text(text, max_words=128): \"\"\" Divide text into chunks where each chunk contains the maximum number of full sentences with fewer words than `max_words`. \"\"\" sentences = text.split(\".\") chunk = [] word_count = 0 for sentence in sentences: sentence = sentence.strip(\".\") if not sentence: continue words_in_sentence = len(sentence.split()) if word_count + words_in_sentence <= max_words: chunk.append(sentence) word_count += words_in_sentence else: # Yield the current chunk and start a new one if chunk: yield \". \".join(chunk).strip() + \".\" chunk = [sentence] word_count = words_in_sentence # Yield the last chunk if it\\'s not empty if chunk: yield \" \".join(chunk).strip() + \".\" Get Embeddings for Each Chunk We need an embedding for each chunk to store it in the FAISS database.

Each week we will focus on a particular discipline and use it to design and operate a wind farm. 2. Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: For example, we look at how to characterize the wind and wave conditions at a given location. How to best place the wind turbines in a farm and also how to retrieve the electricity back to shore. We look at the main design drivers for offshore wind turbines and their components. We\\'ll see how these aspects influence one another and the best choices to reduce the cost of energy. This course is organized by the two-delfd wind energy institute, an interfaculty research organization focusing specifically on wind energy. You will therefore benefit from the expertise of the lecturers in three different faculties of the university. Aerospace engineering, civil engineering and electrical engineering. Hi, my name is Ricardo Pareda. 3. Video-title: Systems Analysis for Problem Structuring part 1B the mono actor perspective example, transcript-segment: So let\\'s assume the demarcation of the problem and the analysis of objectives has led to the identification of three criteria. The security of supply, the percentage of offshore power generation and the costs of energy provision. We now reason backwards to explore what factors have an influence on these system outcomes. Really, the offshore percentage is positively influenced by the installed Wind Power capacity at sea, a key system factor. Capacity at sea in turn is determined by both the size and the number of wind farms at sea. The Ministry of Economic Affairs cannot itself invest in new wind farms but hopes to simulate investors and energy companies by providing subsidies and by expediting the granting process of licenses as needed. Question: When was the first offshore wind farm commissioned? Answer: [/INST] Pass this prompt to the LLM endpoint — model_predictor — via the method model_predictor.predict(): answer = model_predictor.predict({\"inputs\": prompt_for_llm}) This returns a list, but since we only passed in one prompt, it will be a list with one entry. Each entry is a dict with the response text under the key generated_text: answer = answer[0][\\'generated_text\\'] print(answer) Result: The first offshore wind farm was commissioned in 1991. (Context: Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: Since the first offshore wind farm commissioned in 1991 in Denmark, ...) Let’s simplify querying by writing a function to do all the steps: taking the string question as a parameter and returning the answer as a string: def ask_rag(question): search_results = find_most_similar_transcript_segment(question) reranked_results = rerank_results(search_results, question) prompt_for_llm = prompt_template.substitute( question = question, title_1 = search_results[0][0], segment_1 = search_results[0][1], title_2 = search_results[1][0], segment_2 = search_results[1][1], title_3 = search_results[2][0], segment_3 = search_results[2][1], ) answer = model_predictor.predict({\"inputs\": prompt_for_llm}) return answer[0][\"generated_text\"] Now we can ask it a few more questions. Answers will depend on the content of the video transcripts. For example, we can ask detailed questions when the answer is present in the data and get an answer: ask_rag(\"What is a Kaplan Meyer estimator?\") The Kaplan Meyer estimator is a non-parametric estimator for the survival function, defined for both censored and not censored data. It is represented as a series of declining horizontal steps that approaches the truths of the survival function if the sample size is sufficiently large enough.

Reranker API Maximize the search relevancy and RAG accuracy at ease What is a Reranker? Understanding the concept of a reranker often leads us to question the necessity of re-ranking mechanisms in search (ranking) systems. Common questions are, \"Why do we need a reranker?\" and \"Isn\\'t ranking documents by cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings enough already?\" To address these questions, let\\'s first revisit the single embedding cosine similarity approach and its limitations. Cosine similarity quantifies the similarity between two documents by measuring the cosine of the angle between their embedding vectors. This metric is valued for its simplicity and has been used in many vector databases as the default way of retrieval. However, this approach, commonly termed as a representation-based approach, tends to oversimplify interaction between query and documents. Specifically, it struggles with capturing the nuanced interaction at the sub-document level and sub-query level, often missing the full depth of user intent and the fine details of document relevance. The comparison of the representation-based cosine similarity (left) and the reranker (right). This is where rerankers come into play. Utilizing deep neural networks, rerankers delve deeper into the interactions between the query and the shortlisted documents. They move beyond basic document-level embeddings to embrace token-level interactions that occur within the query, within the document, and across the query-document boundary. Although this method is more computationally intensive compared to simple cosine similarity, it enables a nuanced comparison that incorporates context, semantic meaning, and the intent behind the query, substantially improving the relevancy of search results.

The name \"ColBERT\" stands for Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT, a model stems from the Stanford University, that leverages the deep language understanding of BERT while introducing a novel interaction mechanism. This mechanism, known as late interaction, allows for efficient and precise retrieval by processing queries and documents separately until the final stages of the retrieval process. Specifically, there are two versions of the model: ColBERT: The initial model was the brainchild of Omar Khattab and Matei Zaharia, presenting a novel approach to information retrieval through the \"ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT\" paper. Their work was published in SIGIR 2020. ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT Recent progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is driving fast-paced advances in Information Retrieval (IR), largely owed to fine-tuning deep language models (LMs) for document ranking. While remarkably effective, the ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Beyond reducing the cost of re-ranking the documents retrieved by a traditional model, ColBERT’s pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large document collection. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage search datasets. Results show that ColBERT’s effectiveness is competitive with existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring four orders-of-magnitude fewer FLOPs per query. arXiv.org Omar Khattab The original ColBERT paper that introduces the \"late interaction\". ColBERTv2: Building on the foundational work, Omar Khattab continued his research, collaborating with Barlas Oguz, Matei Zaharia, and Michael S. Bernstein to introduce \"ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction,\" presented at SIGIR 2021. This next iteration of ColBERT addressed previous limitations and introduced key improvements, such as denoised supervision and residual compression, enhancing both the model\\'s retrieval effectiveness and its storage efficiency. ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction Neural information retrieval (IR) has greatly advanced search and other knowledge-intensive language tasks. While many neural IR methods encode queries and documents into single-vector representations, late interaction models produce multi-vector representations at the granularity of each token and decompose relevance modeling into scalable token-level computations. This decomposition has been shown to make late interaction more effective, but it inflates the space footprint of these models by an order of magnitude. In this work, we introduce ColBERTv2, a retriever that couples an aggressive residual compression mechanism with a denoised supervision strategy to simultaneously improve the quality and space footprint of late interaction. We evaluate ColBERTv2 across a wide range of benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art quality within and outside the training domain while reducing the space footprint of late interaction models by 6--10 × ×. arXiv.org Keshav Santhanam ColBERTv2 adding denoised supervision and residual compression to improve the training data\\'s quality and reduce the space footprint.

What is late interaction in ColBERT? \"Interaction\" refers to the process of evaluating the relevance between a query and a document by comparing their representations. \"Late interaction\" is the essence of ColBERT. The term is derived from the model\\'s architecture and processing strategy, where the interaction between the query and document representations occurs late in the process, after both have been independently encoded. This contrasts with \"early interaction\" models, where query and document embeddings interact at earlier stages, typically before or during their encoding by the model. Interaction Type Models Early Interaction BERT, ANCE, DPR, Sentence-BERT, DRMM, KNRM, Conv-KNRM, etc. Late Interaction ColBERT, ColBERTv2 Early interaction can increase computational complexity since it requires considering all possible query-document pairs, making it less efficient for large-scale applications. Late interaction models like ColBERT optimize for efficiency and scalability by allowing for the pre-computation of document representations and employing a more lightweight interaction step at the end, which focuses on the already encoded representations. This design choice enables faster retrieval times and reduced computational demands, making it more suitable for processing large document collections. Schematic diagrams illustrating query–document interaction paradigms in neural IR, with ColBERT\\'s late interaction on the left-most. No interaction: cosine similarity of document and query embeddings Many practical vector databases and neural search solutions depend on fast cosine similarity matching between document and query embeddings. While appealing for its straightforwardness and computational efficiency, this method, often referred to as \"no interaction\" or \"not interaction-based\" has been found to underperform in comparison to models that incorporate some form of interaction between queries and documents. The core limitation of the \"no interaction\" approach lies in its inability to capture the complex nuances and relationships between query and document terms. Information retrieval, at its heart, is about understanding and matching the intent behind a query with the content within a document. This process often requires a deep, contextual understanding of the terms involved, something that single, aggregated embeddings for documents and queries struggle to provide. Query and document encoders in ColBERT ColBERT\\'s encoding strategy is grounded in the BERT model, known for its deep contextual understanding of language. The model generates dense vector representations for each token in a query or document, creating a bag of contextualized embeddings for a query and a bag for a document, respectively. This facilitates a nuanced comparison of their embeddings during the late interaction phase. Query encoder of ColBERT For a query 𝑄 Q with tokens 𝑞 1 , 𝑞 2 , . . . , 𝑞 𝑙 q 1 \\u200b ,q 2 \\u200b ,...,q l \\u200b , the process begins by tokenizing 𝑄 Q into BERT-based WordPiece tokens and prepending a special [Q] token. This [Q] token, positioned right after BERT’s [CLS] token, signals the start of a query. If the query is shorter than a predefined number of tokens 𝑁 𝑞 N q \\u200b , it is padded with [mask] tokens up to 𝑁 𝑞 N q \\u200b ; otherwise, it\\'s truncated to the first 𝑁 𝑞 N q \\u200b tokens. The padded sequence is then passed through BERT, followed by a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and normalization. The output is a set of embedding vectors termed as 𝐸 𝑞 E q \\u200b below: 𝐸 𝑞 : = N o r m a l i z e ( B E R T ( [ 𝑄 ] , 𝑞 0 , 𝑞 1 , … , 𝑞 𝑙 [ 𝑚 𝑎 𝑠 𝑘 ] , [ 𝑚 𝑎 𝑠 𝑘 ] , … , [ 𝑚 𝑎 𝑠 𝑘 ] ) ) E q \\u200b :=Normalize(BERT([Q],q 0 \\u200b ,q 1 \\u200b ,…,q l \\u200b [mask],[mask],…,[mask])) Document encoder of ColBERT Similarly, for a document 𝐷 D with tokens 𝑑 1 , 𝑑 2 , . . . , 𝑑 𝑛 d 1 \\u200b ,d 2 \\u200b ,...,d n \\u200b , a [D] token is prepended to indicate the start of a document.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4128, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The [Q] and [D] tokens explicitly mark the start of queries and documents, respectively, aiding the model in distinguishing between the two types of inputs. Comparing ColBERT to cross-encoders Cross-encoders process pairs of queries and documents together, making them highly accurate but less efficient for large-scale tasks due to the computational cost of evaluating every possible pair. They excel in specific scenarios where the precise scoring of sentence pairs is necessary, such as in semantic similarity tasks or detailed content comparison. However, this design limits their applicability in situations requiring rapid retrieval from large datasets, where pre-computed embeddings and efficient similarity calculations are paramount. In contrast, ColBERT’s late interaction model allows for pre-computation of document embeddings, significantly speeding up the retrieval process without compromising the depth of semantic analysis. This method, though seemingly counter-intuitive when compared to the direct approach of cross-encoders, offers a scalable solution for real-time and large-scale information retrieval tasks. It represents a strategic compromise between computational efficiency and the quality of interaction modeling. Finding the top-K documents using ColBERT Once we have embeddings for the query and documents, finding the most relevant top-K documents becomes straightforward (but not as straightforward as computing cosine of two vectors). The key operations include a batch dot-product to compute term-wise similarities, max-pooling across document terms to find the highest similarity per query term, and summation across query terms to derive the total document score, followed by sorting the documents based on these scores. The pseudo PyTorch code is described below: import torch def compute_relevance_scores(query_embeddings, document_embeddings, k): \"\"\" Compute relevance scores for top-k documents given a query. :param query_embeddings: Tensor representing the query embeddings, shape: [num_query_terms, embedding_dim] :param document_embeddings: Tensor representing embeddings for k documents, shape: [k, max_doc_length, embedding_dim] :param k: Number of top documents to re-rank :return: Sorted document indices based on their relevance scores \"\"\" # Ensure document_embeddings is a 3D tensor: [k, max_doc_length, embedding_dim] # Pad the k documents to their maximum length for batch operations # Note: Assuming document_embeddings is already padded and moved to GPU # Compute batch dot-product of Eq (query embeddings) and D (document embeddings) # Resulting shape: [k, num_query_terms, max_doc_length] scores = torch.matmul(query_embeddings.unsqueeze(0), document_embeddings.transpose(1, 2)) # Apply max-pooling across document terms (dim=2) to find the max similarity per query term # Shape after max-pool: [k, num_query_terms] max_scores_per_query_term = scores.max(dim=2).values # Sum the scores across query terms to get the total score for each document # Shape after sum: [k] total_scores = max_scores_per_query_term.sum(dim=1) # Sort the documents based on their total scores sorted_indices = total_scores.argsort(descending=True) return sorted_indices Note that this procedure is used in both training and re-ranking at inference time.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=4031, end_char_idx=7868, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The model aims to learn representations such that the similarity score between 𝑞 q and 𝑑 + d + is higher than the score between q and 𝑑 − d − . The training objective can be mathematically represented as minimizing the following loss function: L o s s = max \\u2061 ( 0 , 1 − 𝑆 ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 + ) + 𝑆 ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 − ) ) Loss=max(0,1−S(q,d + )+S(q,d − )) , where 𝑆 ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 ) S(q,d) denotes the similarity score computed by ColBERT between a query 𝑞 q and a document 𝑑 d. This score is obtained by aggregating the max-similarity scores of the best-matching embeddings between the query and the document, following the late interaction pattern described in the model architecture. This approach ensures that the model is trained to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant documents for a given query, by encouraging a larger margin in the similarity scores for positive and negative document pairs. Denoised supervision in ColBERTv2 Denoised supervision in ColBERTv2 refines the original training process by selecting challenging negatives and leveraging a cross-encoder for distillation.

The indexing strategy of ColBERT Unlike representation-based approaches that encode each document into one embedding vector, ColBERT encodes documents (and queries) into bags of embeddings, with each token in a document having its own embedding. This approach inherently means that for longer documents, more embeddings will be stored, which is a pain point of the original ColBERT, and later addressed by ColBERTv2. The key to managing this efficiently lies in ColBERT\\'s use of vector database (e.g. FAISS) for indexing and retrieval, and its detailed indexing process which is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently. The original ColBERT paper mentions several strategies to enhance the efficiency of indexing and retrieval, including: Offline Indexing: Document representations are computed offline, allowing for the pre-computation and storage of document embeddings. This process leverages batch processing and GPU acceleration to handle large document collections efficiently. Embedding Storage: Document embeddings can be stored using 32-bit or 16-bit values for each dimension, offering a trade-off between precision and storage requirements. This flexibility allows ColBERT to maintain a balance between effectiveness (in terms of retrieval performance) and efficiency (in terms of storage and computational costs). The introduction of residual compression in ColBERTv2, which is a novel approach not present in the original ColBERT, plays a key role in reducing the model\\'s space footprint by 6–10× while preserving quality. This technique compresses the embeddings further by effectively capturing and storing only the differences from a set of fixed reference centroids. Effectiveness and Efficiency of ColBERT One might initially assume that incorporating BERT\\'s deep contextual understanding into search would inherently require significant computational resources, making such an approach less feasible for real-time applications due to high latency and computational costs. However, ColBERT challenges and overturns this assumption through its innovative use of the late interaction mechanism. Here are some noteworthy points: Significant Efficiency Gains: ColBERT achieves an orders-of-magnitude reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and latency compared to traditional BERT-based ranking models. Specifically, for a given model size (e.g., 12-layer \"base\" transformer encoder), ColBERT not only matches but in some cases exceeds the effectiveness of BERT-based models with dramatically lower computational demands. For instance, at a re-ranking depth of k=10, BERT requires nearly 180× more FLOPs than ColBERT; this gap widens as k increases, reaching 13900× at k=1000 and even 23000× at k=2000\\u200b\\u200b.

Practicality for Real-World Applications: The experimental results underline ColBERT\\'s practical applicability for real-world scenarios.

This scalability is counter-intuitive when considering the complexity and depth of understanding required for effective document retrieval, showcasing ColBERT\\'s innovative approach to balancing computational efficiency with retrieval effectiveness.

(Gary Marcus, I mean you too!) “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI) is, to put it mildly, a controversial concept in AI research. The word is of recent vintage, dating to about the turn of the 21st century, and comes from an attempt to make clearer an idea that has circulated in AI since, arguably, before the invention of computers. It’s gone by a lot of names over the years: “true AI,” “real AI”, “strong AI,” “human-equivalent AI,” etc. The history of attempts to define it in some testable way is, to say the least, not encouraging, but it doesn’t seem to stop anyone from trying. The Curses of AI Artificial intelligence is a cursed field. The word was coined by John McCarthy in 1956, in large part to distinguish it from “cybernetics,” a label associated with Norbert Wiener, who saw it as an interdisciplinary field with political implications that did not appeal to McCarthy and his colleagues. So, from the very beginning, AI has been associated with intellectual hubris and disinterest in social consequences, willfully distancing itself from the humanities — the study of human works — while purporting to build machines that do the work of humans. That is one of AI's great curses: There is an expansive, argumentative, routinely acrimonious literature on the nature of intelligence and human intellectual abilities, dating back centuries and even millennia, and discussions of artificial intelligence reference it approximately never. How exactly are you going to discuss “artificial intelligence” if you can’t say what it means for something to be intelligent, or how you would demonstrate that? Agüera y Arcas of Google and Norvig are not especially clear on how they’ve defined “general intelligence” despite having a section titled “What Is General Intelligence?” Broadly, their claim seems to be: General intelligences can do more than one kind of thing. General intelligences can do things that their designers didn’t specifically intend for them to be able to do. General intelligences can do things that are specified in your instructions to them rather than their programming. This is my summary, and perhaps I have misunderstood them, but the section where they explain this goes on a number of tangents that make it hard to identify what they intend to say. They appear to be using the label “general intelligence” to contrast with “narrow intelligence,” another new term (I can’t find reference to it before the 2010s) that seems to have the same relationship to what we used to call “weak AI” as “general intelligence” has to “strong AI.” They define it as follows: Narrowly intelligent systems typically perform a single or predetermined set of tasks, for which they are explicitly trained. Even multitask learning yields only narrow intelligence because the models still operate within the confines of tasks envisioned by the engineers. They contrast this with “general intelligence”: By contrast, frontier language models can perform competently at pretty much any information task that can be done by humans, can be posed and answered using natural language, and has quantifiable performance. This approach poses some obvious problems. It defines artificial general intelligence to exist only when engineers have poor imaginations. That doesn’t seem quite right. The most frequently cited example of an AI model performing outside of its explicit training (a.k.a. zero-shot learning) is the “zebra” example: Let us say we have a multimodal AI model that has never had a picture of a zebra or mention of a zebra anywhere in its training data. So we tell it that a zebra is a horse with stripes, and then we present it with pictures, some of zebras, some not, and ask it if each one is a zebra. The current generation of multimodal models is capable of doing a good job of this. I don’t know if this is exactly what Agüera y Arcas and Norvig have in mind as performing outside of “the confines of tasks envisioned by the engineers” because they give no examples, nor does the article they link to on this subject. (”A general AI model can perform tasks the designers never envisioned.”) But this kind of zero-shot learning does seem to be what they mean. However, it's not clear that this really is an example of going outside of the tasks envisioned by the model's designers. Given that the model was explicitly trained to recognize horses and stripes and to connect the features it finds in images to natural language words and statements, it was explicitly trained to handle all parts of the problem. So is it right to say it’s exceeded the bounds of “narrow intelligence?” Other zero-shot learning examples suffer from the same problem.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4808, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Also, unexpected correct results from computers have been around for some time. As an example, this article from 1999 shows a logistic planner in a NASA space probe doing something that not only was correct and unexpected but that the engineers could never have had in mind when they designed it.

API limits Good luck with the GPT-4V API! In our extensive testing (even just to write this blog post), we rapidly and repeatedly hit request limits. An organization is limited to 100 requests per day, along with strict throttling. We would\\'ve put this post out earlier if we hadn\\'t easily overshot that multiple times. Hello RateLimitError, my old friend. Reliability If you do try to extract strings via the web interface, results can be unpredictable. It can handle English well enough: We can extract the strings as JSON by using the prompt: Extract the text strings from this image and populate a JSON that follows this schema: { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"text_strings\": { \"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"Every text string contained in the image. Consider all languages\" } } } Return just the output JSON. Do not put it in a code block Note how specific we had to be in this prompt, explaining that we just wanted raw JSON back, not including comments like “Here is your JSON” and then a back-ticked code block. There is still no guarantee that such a method is watertight. It may sometimes return extraneous content. It returns this output: { \"text_strings\": [ \"YOU CAN\\'T RUN\", \"FROM US FOREVER\", \"m\" ] } I would’ve preferred some prettier, indented output. But it looks like valid JSON and accurate output. For reference, SceneXplain returns: { \"text_strings\": [ \"YOU CAN\\'T RUN\", \"FROM US FOREVER\", \"M\" ] } Ah, those sweet sweet indents Now let’s try asking in natural language about a Chinese ad: If we use the prompt: Extract the text strings from this image, GPT-4V gives us: It seems there was an error while attempting to extract the text from the image using OCR. The error message indicates a problem with the Tesseract OCR data files for the Chinese simplified language. The necessary language files may not be installed in the environment where the OCR operation was attempted. Given this issue, I\\'m unable to extract the text from the image as requested. If there\\'s anything else you would like me to assist you with, please let me know! That’s…not useful. However, asking it to extract it as JSON (by using the above prompt with schema) works: { \"text_strings\": [ \"麦当劳\", \"一周七天\", \"早晨四点\", \"至\", \"17:00 时段\", \"周末早餐 延时\", \"更多惊喜\", \"尽在麦当劳APP\" ] } Why can it do the job if we specify we want JSON output, but it just shrugs helplessly if we ask in plain English? Who knows. Accuracy Take another look at that JSON output. Then, take a look at the ad. At first glance, the JSON looks decent. It’s got the 17:00 and other details. But take a closer look. None of those text strings appear in the image. They look like the kind of strings that could occur in a Chinese McDonald\\'s ad, but none of them are actually in that particular ad. This can be even more dangerous than being wrong - enough people are already worried about GPT mansplaining - i.e., being confident but wrong. We see the same story when it comes to non-Latin text too. Also, why does it suddenly think it can extract the text when it stated before that it couldn’t?

SceneXplain Head to head: GPT-4V vs SceneXplain Let’s put both services to the test and see who comes out on top. 💡 See our notebook for the full range of testing and results. Testing methodology We took a selection of images, some from pexels.com and some from searching Google Images for advertisements in the given languages: Chinese (we didn\\'t differentiate between Simplified and Traditional) Japanese Korean Arabic Hindi We then used: SceneXplain\\'s API (using the Jelly algorithm) A combination of the GPT-4V API and web frontend (since we quickly blasted through our API request limit) We ran several rounds of tests: Basic image description: For SceneXplain, we just uploaded the image. For GPT-4V, we asked: What is in the image? Visual question answering: We uploaded the image to both services and asked: What does the text say in this image? JSON output: For SceneXplain, we simply used the \"Extract JSON from image\" feature and a predefined JSON Schema. The JSON Schema was as follows: { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"text_strings\": { \"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"Every text string contained in the image.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=3352, end_char_idx=6222, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The JSON Schema was as follows: { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"text_strings\": { \"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"Every text string contained in the image.

Do not put it in a code block\" The results below focus on the JSON outputs since those are (in our opinion) the most useful outputs for real-world usage. 💡 To save space, we’ve simplified the JSON output to include just the text strings, not the rest of the JSON structure. Chinese We’ve already dived into the McDonald’s ad above, so we’ll just look at one more Chinese image: SceneXplain output: [ \"金钱肚20元\", \"旺角牛筋腩20元\", \"旺角牛杂18元\" ] GPT-4V output: [ \"竹筴魚\", \"20元\", \"甜甜圈\", \"20元\", \"甜甜仙貝\", \"18元\" ] Again, we see GPT-4V gets the menu contents wrong and also splits each price from the (wrong) menu item. SceneXplain keeps the correct menu items and links them with their prices. Japanese GPT-4V gets some of the characters correct in the cigarette ad. The string 私はただ吸い殻になります has most of the same characters but is still a bit off. Other strings are just hallucinated. [ \"私はただ吸い殻になります\", \"PLAISIR\", \"純正\", \"MICRONITE\", \"新式\", \"すべての味\" ] SceneXplain: [ \"私はたばこを吸います\", \"PLAISIR\", \"独占\", \"MICRONITE\", \"新た\", \"シガレット\", \"喜びの味\", \"KING SIZE\" ] GPT-4V: After extracting (wrong) text from Chinese and Japanese images, we uploaded another image with the prompt Now do this one (which we’d used successfully to repeat prior commands).

Using satellite data for classifying land use involves working out what a section of the Earth is used for, such as agriculture, city, forest, or body of water. The focus here is on using optical satellite imagery as the data source, which is then analyzed through AI image models to determine the land use. It's often used for: Resource Management: Knowing how land is being used aids in allocating and managing resources, such as water for irrigation. Urban Planning: Good land use maps are invaluable to city planners so that they can know what types of land use exist in and around urban areas to make informed decisions on infrastructure development. Environmental Protection: By identifying sensitive or critical ecological zones, conservationists can better protect and manage them. Disaster Management: Land use classification can help to identify vulnerable areas that require priority during emergencies. Climate Change Studies: Monitoring land use over time can offer insights into climate change impacts, such as the rate of deforestation. Research and Education: Scientists and educators across disciplines use this data for various kinds of research, from ecology to social sciences. Up, up, and away! How we classify land usage in SceneXplain 🐍 You can find a link to the notebook here. Datasets We used three datasets for our testing: UC Merced land use classification AID (Aerial Image Dataset) RESISC45 (Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification) Each of these consists of satellite and aerial images of different sections of Earth, labeled by what they are used for, e.g. dense_residential, round_farm, intersection, etc. airport from AID dataset, denseresidential from UC Merced dataset, chaparral from RESISC45 dataset\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1795, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

After testing with several algorithms, we saw the Flash algorithm offered the fastest performance, and precision on par with more recent algorithms like Jelly.

The ID would contain the image\\'s \"official\" category, so (after processing) we could extract that and compare it to the category assigned by SceneXplain. JSON Schema Why even use a JSON schema? Why not just let SceneXplain interpret the images directly? Say, by looking at an aerial view of a baseball diamond from the UC Merced dataset? Here\\'s why: Link to this scene on SceneXplain It’s a clear description, but nowhere does it mention baseballdiamond, which (since we’re doing classification) is the label we want. We could also try asking it a question using visual question answering (VQA): Link to this scene on SceneXplain That answer is slightly better, but still throws in a lot more superfluous words. If we were to bulk classify images using this method we would have to search each answer for the category label, since there would be no consistent wording between them. And what would happen if an image were ambiguous and SceneXplain tried to assign it two categories or more? For this reason, we used SceneXplain’s “Extract JSON from image” feature, where we specify a JSON Schema and can thus get highly structured, standardized output: Link to this scene on SceneXplain', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1717, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Does it work? Sometimes! Like at least 60% of the time! In some randomized tests we got close to 80% (or occasionally as low as 50%). Several factors can cause it to fail: Some categories can look very similar, e.g. sparse_residential, medium_residential, dense_residential. SceneXplain often picks the wrong one. This can also be seen in cases like road vs runway. Occasionally it hallucinates a new category not specified in the enum, for example residential (as opposed to denseresidential). Occasionally it glitches and assigns a category like A. Some category names like chaparral are uncommon words and/or concepts. It seems unlikely that many pictures of (or references to) chaparrals are in its training datasets. With so little data, the model barely knows what a chaparral is or what it looks like.

This means that to a general-purpose tool like SceneXplain, an aerial view of a chaparral may look more like mold or dirt on a surface. One of these is mold. The other is chaparral. Sorry, California. Why not use a dedicated model? Most land-use classification is indeed done with dedicated models, specifically trained on aerial-view land use imagery. This makes them perfect for that particular task while not being so hot at general image classification. So, why not just use one of those? Self-hosting is a drag Even self-hosting something like Resnet (which has decent tutorials) is a drag. You need to set up AWS, install dependencies, compile the model, and so on. It’s not as easy as using an existing software-as-a-service like SceneXplain. Academic models are pure kryptonite Let's look at the AID dataset and see how we can replicate what they did in their paper: First of all, we have to download the code from OneDrive or Baidu Pan. Dang, the file no longer exists on OneDrive, and Baidu Pan wants me to install a random RPM or DEB file just to download the dataset. Blech. Parents: Please check your children's Halloween candy. I just found a Baidu Pan installation RPM in my kid's bag. Disgusting. Assuming we have a friend in China who downloads the code and sends it to us (thanks Kelly!), we can extract it and check the readme.txt (Did you assume the readme would be in a repo somewhere, you sweet innocent summer child?) Checking the file dates with ls -l, we see the files were last modified in 2016. Great. Now we download the pre-trained model from the URL in the readme. Good news! The link works! Bad news! There are lots of CNNs there and the readme doesn't say which one to download! To quote the readme, the next step is to: Compile vlfeat, gist, matconvnet and liblinear, and place them under <libs>. We didn't actually try this, but I'm sure compiling software from over five years ago will go without a hitch. I just need to use version...um. There's no version specified. It's sheer dumb luck I guess! The final step: We've put so much work into the other steps that now we can finally reap the fruits of our labor. We just need to install MatLab. Which is 860 EUR per year. Wonderful. I'm sure setting up the model was worth the effort for whoever wrote the paper. But if I'm just trying things out, that's a lot of work and money. 💢 On the verge of giving up, I checked the directory structure of the code. Reading the readme, I assumed I had to download the libs. But the libs folder already exists. Already (supposedly) populated with what I need. Turns out I can't even trust the readme (or perhaps myself, to be honest) I got ninety-nine problems, but a chaparral ain't one Even assuming pre-trained models were simple to use, the categories are baked in already. Since most of the training data was (I assume) taken from California, chaparrals are all over the place, but there aren't so many medieval castles. So if I wanted to apply the same model to Europe, I'd be stuck with those categories. On the other hand, SceneXplain is a general-purpose tool. This means it may not have extensive chaparral knowledge (seriously, outside of Californians, who among us does?), but it has enough general-purpose knowledge that it can more reliably classify what you're specifically looking for. Let's just say that specialist data can be kryptonite to a general-purpose image classification/captioning model. AI models aren’t (and can’t be) all things to all people, after all. When you think of the data used to train general-purpose image models, very little would be aerial views of the landscape taken from satellites and labels for such data (road, residential, etc.) would far more commonly be applied to pictures of those phenomena taken from a more human-centric angle.

SceneXplain isn't as accurate as pre-trained models While a pain to set up, pre-trained models offer superior accuracy when it comes to this very specific domain. Those models were trained specifically on aerial imagery and thus offer accuracy rates of 85-95% when using high-level methods (see final table in the AID dataset paper), compared to SceneXplain's accuracy of about 60%. Next steps Large language models and image-to-text models aren’t specially trained to recognize landscape types from satellite imagery. There’s enough in their training data to make a stab at it, and it’s not totally useless, but zero-shot detection is just not good. Some categories are (by their nature) going to be tough to recognize, even for a human. If we can’t tell from 30,000 feet how many people live on a city block, then how could we expect SceneXplain to tell sparseresidential from mediumresidential? Specially trained and fine-tuned models perform well enough to be a hard bar to beat. But often you hit upon a problem that doesn’t have a specialized dataset that can be used for training a dedicated model. That means that a general-purpose tool, like SceneXplain, may be your best bet. Our next steps are trying to see how much better we can make SceneX with the least effort, so that our users can always get the best performance possible for the least added effort. Even if no one ever uses SceneXplain to catalog land use, learning to make it better at this task teaches us how to make it better for something else that it’s never specially learned to do.

ALiBi is an alternative to the positional encoding system first proposed in the famous “Attention is all you need” paper. This scheme makes it possible to train embedding models on short texts and still get high-quality results on longer texts. For Jina Embeddings 2, Jina AI has taken the BERT architecture and grafted it into ALiBi. ALiBi was originally proposed for text generators (like ChatGPT) that only care about dependencies on previous words. This means that the last tokens in the input matter more than earlier ones because a text generator’s task is to produce the next word after the input. This makes no sense for an embedding model that tries to create a representation of the whole text input, so Jina Embeddings 2 models implement a bi-directional version of ALiBi. This architectural change, however, means that we can’t use the pre-training of the original BERT model and have to completely retrain the model from scratch.

We start with masked word pre-training using the circa 170 billion word English-only C4 dataset. Then, we do pairwise contrastive training. This means taking pairs of texts that are known to be similar or dissimilar and adjusting the weights of the embedding model so that similar inputs are closer together, and dissimilar ones are farther apart. We used a new corpus of text pairs, curated by Jina AI, based on the one used to train the Jina Embeddings 1 models. Finally, we fine-tuned the model using text triplets and negative mining, with an in-house training dataset specially augmented with sentences of opposite grammatical polarity. Embedding models have typically had trouble with negative polarity sentences: A sentence like “The dog is in the car” will often have an embedding close to “The dog is outside the car,” even though these are naturally opposite in meaning.

Their platform features an extensive selection of emerging and well-known brands, with a total of around two million product images, spanning all their product categories. The client\\'s vision was clear: automatically generate basic and specific descriptions for all these images and, more importantly, categorize them with detailed tags to improve user experience and enhance search result quality. Why They Started Looking For A New Solution \"We were facing significant challenges in managing our vast catalog of product images. Manual image description generation was too time-consuming. We needed a solution to save time and resources and provide comprehensive product tagging. SceneXplain was the game-changer that helped us achieve this.\" - Sales Director 1. Efficiently Generating Descriptions: With two million images to manage, creating descriptions for each one manually was a time–consuming and inefficient task. It took roughly a week for them to write descriptions for the first seven thousand images. The client sought an automated solution to save valuable time and resources. 2. Better Product Tagging: They wanted a comprehensive tagging system that went beyond general descriptions. They needed to categorize products by attributes such as color, gender, and more, all while maintaining a consistent schema for easy management.

Retrieval Augmented Generation is a strategy that merges search with language generation. The way it works is that it uses an external information retrieval system to find documents that are likely to inform the answer to a user query. It then passes them, with the user’s request, to a text-generating language model, which produces a natural language response. This allows you to use an LLM to answer questions and use information from documents and sets of documents that are much larger than its input context window. The LLM only sees a few pertinent parts of the document when responding to prompts. This also has the advantage of reducing (although not eliminating) inexplicable hallucinations. This strategy has some limitations: It is sensitive to the input context size supported by the LLM. The larger the context size, the more information you can give the LLM, yielding better and richer responses. It is sensitive to the quality of the results of the initial information retrieval. If your search engine gives it irrelevant or inaccurate results, the LLM may paste them together as best it can and give you garbage output. This can be caused by bad data (as the saying goes garbage in, garbage out) but can also be caused by a search system that does not return the most useful matches or does not rank them highly enough in the results. High-quality embeddings are key to making RAG work because they reduce the impact of these limitations. First, a small context size for an LLM means it’s extra important to find the most relevant information, because you cannot add very much to the user’s prompt. Second, how informative the answer is depends on how informative the input is. If the search results displayed to the LLM are irrelevant or poorly informative, that will be reflected in the result. AI-generated embeddings are, on the whole, the best way to find and rank query results in general. Build a Full RAG Chatbot We will create and install a full RAG system using the LlamaIndex framework for working with LLMs. This system uses Jina Embeddings to index document elements and store them in LlamaIndex’ built-in vector store and search engine. Then, it uses the newly released Mixtral Instruct model to construct natural language answers. The approach in the article will also work with OpenAI’s GPT models and Meta’s Llama2, with some adaptation of the code and possibly the prompt. For more details, read the LlamaIndex documentation.

Embedding API Top-performing, 8192-token length, $100 for 1.25B tokens, seamless OpenAI alternative, free trial Hugging Face – The AI community building the future. We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science. In Python, set up your secret key values like this: jinaai_api_key = \"<your Jina Embeddings API key>\" hf_inference_api_key: str = \\'<your HuggingFace Inference API token>\\' Connect Jina Embeddings LlamaIndex provides built-in support for the Jina Embeddings API. To use it, you only need to initialize the JinaEmbedding object with your API key and model name. For this example, we will use jina-embeddings-v2-base-en. from llama_index.embeddings.jinaai import JinaEmbedding jina_embedding_model = JinaEmbedding( api_key=jinaai_api_key, model=\"jina-embeddings-v2-base-en\", ) Connect Mixtral LLM We will also need to load the Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 model. We will wrap it in a subclass of llama_index.llms.CustomLLM to make it compatible with LlamaIndex. The important elements are the class parameters: model_name: str = \"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\" api_key: str = hf_inference_api_key context_window: int = 4096 num_output: int = 512 The parameter model_name is the name of the model on HuggingFace, in this case, mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, which is also the path part of the URL for its model card on HuggingFace. For api_key, you need to use your HuggingFace Inference API token. Then, specify the input context size the model supports (context_window), in this case, 4096 tokens, and the maximum output size in tokens (num_output), 512. The code below sets up the LLM object in the LlamaIndex framework: from llama_index.llms.huggingface import HuggingFaceInferenceAPI mixtral_llm = HuggingFaceInferenceAPI( model_name=\"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\", token=hf_inference_api_key )', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2272, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The click of cameras capturing moments against the backdrop of thrilling rides and colorful parades was omnipresent.

In stark contrast, just a stone's throw away, nestled in the heart of this revelry, was the Resorts World Convention Centre. Here, the atmosphere was charged with a different kind of excitement. The halls buzzed not with the sound of holiday-making, but with the fervor of intellectual discourse. Young researchers and seasoned academics, their conference badges swaying gently with each step, engaged in animated discussions about the latest in NLP. As I walked into this place, the difference was clear. On one side, there was the loud and happy noise of a holiday resort, full of life and excitement. On the other side, there was a serious and busy atmosphere where people talked about NLP , LLMs, ChatGPT, prompting, and Google's new Gemini model.

However, performing an exact embedding vector search requires one to calculate similarities between the embedding representation of the query and the embedding of each document. This becomes very slow for large datasets and leads to latencies that are not acceptable for real-world search applications. Therefore, many applications use approximated nearest neighbor search techniques to speed up the search system, whereby many of these techniques rely on vector quantization algorithms that learn an index of clusters based on the data distribution. In addition, hybrid search has become popular which combines embedding-based search with traditional BM25-based search techniques. Usually, BM25 and embedding search are performed completely independently in hybrid search settings and only the result sets are combined. Hype and Hybrids: Search is more than Keywords and Vectors Twenty years ago, “hybrid” was a term used only by botanists and chemists. Today, hybrid is booming… even in search. Many search systems are rolling out hybrid search schemes with the latest AI. But is “hybrid search” really more than a buzzword? GitHub This paper proposed a method to train a joined index of two parts: a cluster selector and a term selector. The cluster selector performs a vector quantization to assign texts into buckets of nearby clusters and the term selector determines the most representative terms of a document BM25 can be used to assign it into buckets associated with those terms, however, this is not trainable and can therefore not adjust to the training data. Alternatively, one can determine the most representative terms in a document with a BERT model with an MLP hat which is applied on each token to determine a score. In this way the term selector becomes trainable. Then the cluster centroids and the BERT model are trained together by using the KL divergence loss with the embedding model as a teacher to obtain a distribution of similarity values. The results in the paper show that this method can retrieve more relevant documents in the same amount of time as standard ANN techniques like HNSW and IVF-PQ implementations. Is ChatGPT Good at Search? Investigating Large Language Models as Re-Ranking Agents Is ChatGPT Good at Search? Investigating Large Language Models as Re-Ranking Agents Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization across various language-related tasks, including search engines. However, existing work utilizes the generative ability of LLMs for Information Retrieval (IR) rather than direct passage ranking. The discrepancy between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the ranking objective poses another challenge. In this paper, we first investigate generative LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 for relevance ranking in IR. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that properly instructed LLMs can deliver competitive, even superior results to state-of-the-art supervised methods on popular IR benchmarks. Furthermore, to address concerns about data contamination of LLMs, we collect a new test set called NovelEval, based on the latest knowledge and aiming to verify the model’s ability to rank unknown knowledge. Finally, to improve efficiency in real-world applications, we delve into the potential for distilling the ranking capabilities of ChatGPT into small specialized models using a permutation distillation scheme. Our evaluation results turn out that a distilled 440M model outperforms a 3B supervised model on the BEIR benchmark. The code to reproduce our results is available at www.github.com/sunnweiwei/RankGPT. arXiv.org Weiwei Sun This paper investigates techniques to utilize LLMs for re-ranking documents. Re-ranking is usually performed in a search system after a first retrieval step to re-order the retrieved documents, e.g., to select the most relevant ones among them. Commonly used models are finetuned transformer models which are called cross encoders. Those receive as input a pair composed of a query and a document candidate and return a relevance score. Besides, more traditional learning-to-rank models like LambdaMart are also popular, especially in cases where the ranking is not only done based on semantic relevance itself. Cross-Encoders — Sentence-Transformers documentation Observing the strong NLP capabilities of LLMs, the authors of this paper wanted to investigate whether Models like GPT4 can be used to rank documents better. However, the limitation of those closed API-based models is usually that probability outputs are not accessible. Accordingly, the paper investigates techniques that rely only on prompting and the generated output text for re-ranking.

The technique they propose inserts the documents together with an ID in the prompt and instructs the LLM to output a sequence of IDs with respect to the relevancy of the documents. In cases where the whole set of documents is too long to fit into the prompt, they apply a sliding window approach, where re-ranking is first performed on the documents with the lowest retrieval score obtained from the first-stage retriever. Then the most relevant documents according to the output are presented together with the documents in the next window of retrieval candidates and so on. Since GPT-4 is too expensive and too slow for using it in a real-world setting, the authors propose distilling its ranking capabilities into a transformer-based cross-encoder model. The results show that even a comparably small model (440M parameters) distilled with this technique can outperform much larger state-of-the-art re-ranking models. Large Language Models Can Self-Improve Large Language Models Can Self-Improve Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved excellent performances in various tasks. However, fine-tuning an LLM requires extensive supervision. Human, on the other hand, may improve their reasoning abilities by self-thinking without external inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that an LLM is also capable of self-improving with only unlabeled datasets. We use a pre-trained LLM to generate “high-confidence” rationale-augmented answers for unlabeled questions using Chain-of-Thought prompting and self-consistency, and fine-tune the LLM using those self-generated solutions as target outputs. We show that our approach improves the general reasoning ability of a 540B-parameter LLM (74.4%->82.1% on GSM8K, 78.2%->83.0% on DROP, 90.0%->94.4% on OpenBookQA, and 63.4%->67.9% on ANLI-A3) and achieves state-of-the-art-level performance, without any ground truth label. We conduct ablation studies and show that fine-tuning on reasoning is critical for self-improvement. arXiv.org Jiaxin Huang For many tasks, LLMs achieve already good results in zero-shot settings. However, to improve their performance on specific tasks (beyond zero-shot) common techniques still utilize a lot of training data to fine-tune them. To reduce the amount of training data needed, this paper presents a technique that uses the LLM to “self-improve”. The main idea behind this approach is to augment existing training datasets by using data generated with the LLM itself. This is achieved by using a dataset with only questions and without answers. First, a chain of thoughts (CoT) method is used to generate for each question a couple of different reasoning paths and answers by using a temperature greater than zero to make the generative text non-deterministic. By determining the answer with the highest frequency the probability of the answer being correct can be increased. The paper also shows that LLMs can be used to effectively estimate the confidence of an answer by investigating the consistency of the answer. If a high percentage of the answers is equal, this answer also has a high probability being correct. These most frequent answers and the corresponding reasoning paths can then be used to construct additional prompts for constructing additional training data. However, the authors propose not only to use those reasoning paths and answers but also to add examples in different formats, e.g., presenting the question without any reasoning path and using the question together with some generic instruction like “Let’s think step by step”. Finally, this enhanced training dataset can be used to fine-tune the LLM on the specific task.

Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Transformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents. We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These language models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments, and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT and Llama-2 models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations and find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference costs. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrievalaugmented language modeling and a passage re-ranking task. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution to extend the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts. arXiv.org Alexis Chevalier Language models are usually constrained by limited context length. While there are various techniques like AliBi to construct language models that can handle larger context lengths, those techniques do not help in cases where you want to use an existing model that has only a very limited context length. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi’s inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark. arXiv.org Ofir Press Instead, this paper addresses this problem by introducing a new method that allows one to fine-tune an exciting language model to apply it to longer context lengths. To achieve this, the model's vocabulary is extended by a fixed number of summary tokens, which are supposed to tell the model to summarize the content of the other tokens in the respective embeddings. During inference, the text input is segmented into shorter text sequences which are extended with the summary tokens and prepended with the output summary vectors of the previously processed segments. To fine-tune the model to handle long sequences, the model is trained on a next-token prediction task. Thereby, the model should make use of the information encoded in the summary embeddings of the previous segments. Notably, the segment length is varied during the training and the backpropagation is done for one document as a whole. In other words, the model is first applied to all sequences in the afore-described scheme before starting the backpropagation. The technique is evaluated by the authors on OPT models of various sizes and the 7-B-Llama-2 model.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=7640, end_char_idx=12717, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

ACL Anthology Poster Highlights from EMNLP 2023 At EMNLP 2023, alongside the compelling paper presentations, the poster sessions were a hub of vibrant discussion and exchange. Here's a rundown of some standout posters I came across, each offering a unique glimpse into the ongoing research and development within the field of NLP. Can Retriever-Augmented Language Models Reason? A poster from McGill University examined whether Retriever-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) can effectively reason by balancing the capabilities of both the retriever and the language model. The research highlighted the potential shortcomings of retrievers in sourcing all necessary statements for reasoning, and how language models might falter in reasoning even when provided with the required statements. It was a deep dive into improving the interactive components of language models. Contrastive Learning-based Sentence Encoders Researchers from Tohoku University presented findings on how Contrastive Learning (CL) can induce sentence encoders to implicitly weight informative words, enhancing the model's understanding and processing of language. This approach could refine the way sentence encoders prioritize and process key elements in text, making them more efficient and effective.

Source: TigerGraph - Graph Embedding: Understanding Graph Embedding AlgorithmsS Why is Graph Embedding a Game-Changer? From predicting potential friendships on social media to visualizing intricate datasets, graph embeddings are proving invaluable. They're pivotal in node classification tasks, link predictions, and even in clustering nodes with similar properties. Moreover, as we venture into the realm of multimodal AI, where different types of data converge, graph embeddings can serve as a bridge, connecting structured data with unstructured data. Machine Learning Compatibility: Traditional ML models, from linear regressors to deep neural networks, thrive on numerical data. Graph embeddings translate the intricate relationships of a graph into a numerical format, making them digestible for these models. Preserving Topology and Features: A well-crafted graph embedding retains the original graph's structure and node features. This dual preservation is a challenge that many earlier methods struggled with. Dimensionality Reduction: Instead of grappling with a dimension for every node, we can now work in a much-reduced space, often just 50-1000 dimensions. This simplification is a boon for computational efficiency. Unearthing Latent Patterns: Beyond the explicit, graph embeddings can tease out hidden relationships, offering insights that might not be immediately apparent in the original graph.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1798, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Kipf A Toy Implementation of Graph Embeddings Implementing graph embedding techniques from scratch can be challenging. The algorithm below shows a simple way to generate graph embeddings. It takes an adjacency matrix as input, which represents the connections in a graph. Each row and column corresponds to a node, and a 1 indicates an edge between those nodes. from typing import List import numpy as np def graph_embedding(adj_matrix: List[List[int]], emb_size: int = 16) -> List[np.ndarray]: \"\"\"Generate graph embedding Args: adj_matrix: Adjacency matrix as nested list emb_size: Size of embedding vectors Returns: List of numpy arrays as node embeddings \"\"\" # Initialize empty embeddings embeddings = [np.random.rand(emb_size) for _ in adj_matrix] # Train embedding -visualize nodes moving closer if connected for _ in range(100): for v1, row in enumerate(adj_matrix): for v2, is_connected in enumerate(row): if is_connected: # Move embeddings closer if nodes connected embeddings[v1] -= 0.1 * (embeddings[v1] - embeddings[v2]) return embeddings It initializes an embedding vector of random values for each node. Then it trains these embeddings by iterating through the adjacency matrix to identify connected nodes. For any pair of nodes that are connected, it moves their embedding vectors slightly closer together. This is done by subtracting a fraction of their vector difference from the first node\\'s embedding. Over multiple iterations, nodes that are tightly interconnected will have very similar embedding vectors, while disconnected nodes will remain far apart in the embedding space. The for _ in range(100) loop controls the number of training iterations. More iterations allow the embeddings to converge closer to their optimal values for representing the graph structure. Finally, the embeddings are returned as a list of numpy arrays. Each array is the vector representation for a node.

Graph Embeddings vs. Sentence Embeddings Graph embeddings and sentence embeddings, both aim to distill intricate structures into compact vector forms, yet they cater to distinct data types and possess their own set of challenges and strengths. Let's embark on an expedition to discern their similarities, differences, and unique attributes. The Common Ground Dimensionality Reduction: Both graph and sentence embeddings endeavor to encapsulate high-dimensional data within a more compact, lower-dimensional space. This transformation not only makes the data more tractable but also primes it for machine learning models. Preservation of Relationships: Be it the intricate ties between nodes in a graph or the semantic dance of words in a sentence, both embeddings are committed to ensuring that the spatial relationships in the original structure find their echo in the embedding space. Facilitating Machine Learning: By transmuting graphs and sentences into fixed-length vectors, both embeddings pave the way for the application of a plethora of machine learning algorithms, spanning from clustering to classification. Diving into the Differences Aspect Graph Embedding Sentence Embedding Nature of Data Focuses on relational data, with nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) taking center stage. Hones in on sequential data, where the order and semantic interplay of words are paramount. Embedding Techniques Techniques often orbit around matrix factorization, random walks, or neural networks. For instance, node2vec leverages random walks to encapsulate the graph's neighborhood structure. Methods like Word2Vec or BERT distill embeddings by delving into the context of word appearances. Deep learning architectures, especially transformers, are the tools of choice to capture linguistic intricacies. Applications Finds its niche in tasks like link prediction or node classification. Primarily employed in natural language processing endeavors such as sentiment analysis or machine translation. Challenges The dual task of capturing both the topological intricacies and the attributes of nodes and edges can be daunting. Scalability, especially with mammoth graphs, is another hurdle. Sentences, with their chameleon-like nature, can adopt multiple meanings based on context (polysemy). Grasping these nuances, especially in linguistically rich languages, is a formidable challenge. Challenges and the Road Ahead Graph embeddings, while transformative, are not without their challenges. Striking the right balance between preserving topology and node features is a tightrope walk. As graphs burgeon in size and intricacy, the specter of computational inefficiency looms large. However, as evidenced by initiatives like the RESTORE framework, the community is rallying together, pooling resources and expertise to surmount these challenges.

If prompt engineering is about mastering the keys, fine-tuning is about recalibrating the piano itself. It allows for a deeper, more tailored customization, aligning the model's behavior meticulously with specific datasets. Fine-Tuned Language: Beyond The Machine's Syntax At their core, LLMs like GPT-4 have astounded us with their capabilities. Their prose, though often coherent, has been criticized for lacking the nuanced, idiomatic quality inherent to human language. Now, fine-tuning attempts to blend the machine's efficiency with a touch of human-like idiosyncrasy. OpenAI’s fine-tuning promises to take these models a step further into the realm of nuanced understanding. Preliminary tests hint at a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the mightier GPT-4 in specific domains. Such precision could mean AI transcends beyond mere transactional interactions, evolving into a more collaborative partner, displaying comprehension, imagination, and even a semblance of empathy. The True Potential: Bridging Gaps and Deepening Connections To truly grasp this, let's delve into a few envisioned applications: Medical Chatbots: Picture a chatbot, equipped not just with medical facts but with genuine warmth. Trained on medical research, patient experiences, and counseling techniques, these AI companions could stand as pillars of support for patients, empathetically navigating their concerns and emotions. With inputs from medical journals, patient forums, and consultation transcripts, they could potentially merge hard medical knowledge with compassionate human wisdom. Writing Assistants: The dreaded writer’s block could find its match in an AI muse, tailored to resonate with an author's unique style and influences. Using fine-tuning, one could create an AI writing companion infused with the essence of literary greats, from Vonnegut to Woolf. These would be more than mere tools; they'd be partners in the creative process, guiding writers into realms of unbridled creativity. Farsi-speaking Retail Chatbots: In the world of e-commerce, language should not be a barrier. For Iranian businesses, fine-tuned chatbots equipped with product knowledge and a nuanced understanding of Farsi linguistics could bridge cultural and linguistic divides, ensuring every customer feels at home. This exploration paints a vivid picture. Fine-tuning has the potential to infuse AI systems with curated human wisdom, elevating their capacities to comfort, inspire, and connect. As we progress, ensuring these models reflect our higher values could lead to an AI that appreciates the myriad hues of human experience, transcending its binary origins. Yet, with promise comes price. And this is where we find ourselves at a crossroads.

There's a ballpark figure floating around, suggesting that these generative AI models could inject a few trillion dollars into the world economy annually. That's not pocket change. But here's the hitch. If a computer is becoming more like a human, then it's inheriting all our quirks. Our brilliance, our creativity, yes, but also our biases and blind spots. This isn’t just about AI becoming smart; it’s about AI becoming wise. This is what the tech heads call AI alignment or value alignment. In layman’s terms, it’s making sure AI doesn’t go off the rails, that it plays nicely in the sandbox. The larger we make these models, the more room there is for errors, and not just typos, but grand faux pas. Imagine having all the knowledge of the internet – but also all its myths, prejudices, and midnight conspiracy theories. That's how these large models learn. They gobble up vast chunks of the internet and regurgitate it, warts and all. The stakes? Without this alignment, our well-intentioned AI, given a slightly misdirected task, might churn out content that's harmful or even dangerous. It could inadvertently become the ally of someone with less than honorable intentions or sway someone vulnerable down a dark path. So, when we talk about AI alignment, we’re essentially talking about the guiding principles, the conscience, if you will, of AI. And in a world where AI might soon be as ubiquitous as smartphones, that's something we really ought to get right.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2263, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This is where adversarial testing or 'red teaming' comes in. In simpler terms, this involves inviting experts (both internal and external) to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the model, all to uncover any cracks or vulnerabilities. For instance, before GPT-4's grand entrance, OpenAI summoned over 50 scholars and experts from diverse fields to put it through its paces. Their mission? To probe the model with a gamut of challenging or potentially harmful queries, testing the waters for issues ranging from misinformation and harmful content to biases and sensitive information leakage.

As we continue on this odyssey of aligning AI with our human values, it\\'s an intricate dance of intervention, testing, filtering, and most crucially, understanding. It\\'s about ensuring that as AI grows, it not only knows its strength but uses it wisely. Traversing the AI Labyrinth: A Marathon, Not a Sprint In the vast tapestry of AI research, the notion of \\'value alignment\\' seems to gleam with particular significance. As we delve deeper, it\\'s clear we\\'re at a crossroads of ethics, technology, and perhaps a sprinkle of existential contemplation. Think of it as a bustling intersection, full of potential but not without its challenges. The tech frontier is often marked by rapid leaps and bounds. But as we venture into aligning AI with human values, the question arises: do we select from a curated list of values, or should we stand back, squint, and discern a broader, collective societal heartbeat? The brightest minds in AI have made strides, yet landing on a universally accepted set of \\'human values\\' feels akin to trying to bottle a cloud. It’s intangible, elusive, and endlessly fascinating. And let’s not forget the dizzying pace of AI evolution. It\\'s not just progressing; it’s on a veritable sprint. Our ability to oversee and comprehend is being tested. The crux is this: how do we coalesce with entities whose computational depths may soon eclipse our own grasp? OpenAI\\'s recent gambit, the formation of a \\'Superalignment\\' team, is emblematic of this challenge. It’s about making AI introspective, having it tackle its own alignment issues. Introducing Superalignment We need scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us. To solve this problem within four years, we’re starting a new team, co-led by Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, and dedicating 20% of the compute we’ve secured to date to this effort.

The collective efforts of technologists, policymakers, academics, and visionaries will dictate our trajectory. It’s about ensuring that as AI reaches its zenith, it resonates with our shared ethos. This journey with AI is less a destination and more a shared adventure, brimming with challenges and wonders alike. The finish line is still a speck on the horizon.

The schema is very simple.

Jina provides a smooth Pythonic experience for se… Jina 3.20.1 Documentation docarray.github.io homepage of docarray docarray.github.io You will need to install a number of libraries in your Python environment, specifically the torch, transformers, jina, and docarray libraries, as well as some other supporting libraries if not already present: pip install docarray jina bitsandbytes accelerate transformers Service schemas The first step in creating a streaming service, regardless of framework, is defining service schemas. At its most abstract, the service takes a text input and receives back a stream of tokens. In addition, we provide a parameter for setting the maximum number of tokens to respond with. We construct our schema using DocArray, which is designed to support flexible AI-centric services: from docarray import BaseDoc class PromptDocument(BaseDoc): prompt: str max_tokens: int class ModelOutputDocument(BaseDoc): token_id: int generated_text: str Service initialization Next, we create the token streaming class that is central to our service. This class contains and initializes both the language model and its tokenizer. In the example below, we use the 7B Llama-2-chat model — the smallest of the Llama-2-chat models — and load it using the facilities from the transformer library. It extends the Jina Executor class, which contains a number of methods for handling streams and processes. Note that we've set the device_map parameter to auto, ensuring that the model uses a GPU if it has access to one, and load_in_8bit to True, which quantizes the model to reduce its size in memory. These settings make running our code smoothly on a free Google Colab notebook feasible. from jina import Executor, requests from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM import torch model_name = 'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf' class TokenStreamingExecutor(Executor): def __init__(self, **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs) self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name) self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained( model_name, device_map='auto', load_in_8bit=True ) Implementing the streaming endpoint We implement the streaming endpoint as the task method of the TokenStreamingExecutor. This method processes an instance of PromptDocument and dynamically streams back a sequence of ModelOutputDocument instances. We implement this using Python’s yield keyword in the code below, generating tokens on the fly up to the user-specified maximum number of tokens or until the END token is encountered (self.tokenizer.eos_token_id). Each ModelOutputDocument that the stream returns encapsulates a numerical token ID and its corresponding text string. class TokenStreamingExecutor(Executor): ... def starts_with_space(self, token_id): token = self.tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(token_id) return token.startswith('▁') @requests(on='/stream') async def task(self, doc: PromptDocument, **kwargs) -> ModelOutputDocument: input = self.tokenizer(doc.prompt, return_tensors='pt') input_len = input['input_ids'].shape[1] for output_length in range(doc.max_tokens): output = self.model.generate(**input, max_new_tokens=1) current_token_id = output[0][-1] if current_token_id == self.tokenizer.eos_token_id: break current_token = self.tokenizer.decode( current_token_id, skip_special_tokens=True ) if self.starts_with_space(current_token_id.item()) and output_length > 1: current_token = ' ' + current_token yield ModelOutputDocument( token_id=current_token_id, generated_text=current_token, ) input = { 'input_ids': output, 'attention_mask': torch.ones(1, len(output[0])), }\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3703, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Engineering Group • 4 minutes read At Jina AI, sentence embedding models are a critical component of many natural language processing and multimodal AI systems we develop. By encoding semantic information into vector representations, these models equip systems to assess similarity, retrieve relevant passages, and even generate embeddings tailored to specific downstream tasks. However, a lingering concern around sentence embedding models has been their immense appetite for training data. Models like Sentence-BERT and Sentence-T5 are trained on billions of sentence pairs, demanding substantial computational resources. This causes both financial and environmental strains that limit access and adoption of these models. In our new paper, we demonstrate that with careful data filtering and training methodology, compelling sentence embeddings can be attained using far less data than previously assumed.

Known Limitations In our pursuit of elevating the capabilities of SceneXplain through the Hearth Algorithm, it\\'s vital to be transparent about its current challenges, all while focusing on the nuances of our unique tech stack. Here\\'s an introspective look: Hallucination Issues: The concept of models \"hallucinating\" isn\\'t unfamiliar in deep learning. Specifically, when using algorithms that deeply integrate with LLMs, such as our SceneXplain model, there\\'s a possibility of generating details not present in the source image. This emanates from LLMs being optimized for vast and diverse datasets, sometimes leading them to infer beyond the provided data. However, the field is continuously evolving. By refining SceneXplain\\'s training mechanisms and incorporating more targeted fine-tuning, we aspire to curb such over-generalizations. Speed Constraints: Precision comes at a price: time. The Hearth Algorithm, in its essence, utilizes LLMs, image captioning frameworks like BLIP2 and multimodal embeddings like CLIP. The richness of the narratives it produces is tied to the computational depth it delves into. But as with any AI challenge, it paves the way for innovation. Techniques such as model pruning, tailored for SceneXplain, could optimize its execution speed, enabling faster story derivations without sacrificing their nuance. GitHub - jina-ai/clip-as-service: 🏄 Embed/reason/rank images and sentences with CLIP models 🏄 Embed/reason/rank images and sentences with CLIP models - GitHub - jina-ai/clip-as-service: 🏄 Embed/reason/rank images and sentences with CLIP models GitHub jina-ai Over-Ethical Content Production: It\\'s been observed that the Hearth Algorithm, possibly influenced by the ethically-filtered data it was trained on, leans heavily towards generating highly politically correct content. This has inadvertently made it challenging for the model to craft genres like horror, even when explicitly prompted. This isn\\'t a drawback of the ethical stance but more of a fine-tuning nuance. As we progress, integrating more diverse fine-tuning processes, centered around specific genres while maintaining ethical bounds, can help SceneXplain strike a more balanced narrative approach. Unfortunately, it is extremely hard to generate all story genres even if the users specified so. At SceneXplain, our commitment is steadfast: refine, innovate, and evolve. With the brilliant minds in the community and our dedicated team, these challenges merely represent the next set of puzzles to solve in our AI journey. Conclusion The intersection of large language models and image captioning technologies represents an exciting frontier in AI. With SceneXplain\\'s Hearth Algorithm, we\\'ve embarked on a journey to bridge the gap between visual information and its narrative counterpart.

In the current algorithm, upon receiving an image, SceneXplain simultaneously discerns the primary subjects and contexts, as well as extracting underlying emotions and intricate details from the visuals. These parallel processes use evolved computer vision techniques combined with our legacy understanding methods to grasp the image's essence and nuances. def scene_understanding(image_input): subjects_and_contexts = get_subject_and_object(image_input) emotions_and_details = detect_emotions_and_details(image_input) return subjects_and_contexts, emotions_and_details 2.

Examples: Seeing the Hearth Algorithm in Action While an intricate algorithm and tech-talk can illustrate the prowess of Hearth, the true test lies in real-world application. Let\\'s dive into four handpicked examples to truly appreciate the intricacy and brilliance of the stories our algorithm crafts: 0:00 / 1× 0:00 / 1× 0:00 / 1× 0:00 / 1× The stories above encapsulate the heart of Hearth Algorithm. Not only do they spin a rich tale with unexpected twists and turns, but they also bring the scene to life through vivid character dialogues. Each character, endowed with distinct characteristics and tones, reflects the depth of understanding derived from the image description. Known Limitations In our pursuit of elevating the capabilities of SceneXplain through the Hearth Algorithm, it\\'s vital to be transparent about its current challenges, all while focusing on the nuances of our unique tech stack. Here\\'s an introspective look: Hallucination Issues: The concept of models \"hallucinating\" isn\\'t unfamiliar in deep learning. Specifically, when using algorithms that deeply integrate with LLMs, such as our SceneXplain model, there\\'s a possibility of generating details not present in the source image. This emanates from LLMs being optimized for vast and diverse datasets, sometimes leading them to infer beyond the provided data. However, the field is continuously evolving. By refining SceneXplain\\'s training mechanisms and incorporating more targeted fine-tuning, we aspire to curb such over-generalizations. Speed Constraints: Precision comes at a price: time. The Hearth Algorithm, in its essence, utilizes LLMs, image captioning frameworks like BLIP2 and multimodal embeddings like CLIP. The richness of the narratives it produces is tied to the computational depth it delves into. But as with any AI challenge, it paves the way for innovation. Techniques such as model pruning, tailored for SceneXplain, could optimize its execution speed, enabling faster story derivations without sacrificing their nuance.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=4140, end_char_idx=8918, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This has inadvertently made it challenging for the model to craft genres like horror, even when explicitly prompted. This isn\\'t a drawback of the ethical stance but more of a fine-tuning nuance. As we progress, integrating more diverse fine-tuning processes, centered around specific genres while maintaining ethical bounds, can help SceneXplain strike a more balanced narrative approach. Unfortunately, it is extremely hard to generate all story genres even if the users specified so. At SceneXplain, our commitment is steadfast: refine, innovate, and evolve. With the brilliant minds in the community and our dedicated team, these challenges merely represent the next set of puzzles to solve in our AI journey. Conclusion The intersection of large language models and image captioning technologies represents an exciting frontier in AI. With SceneXplain\\'s Hearth Algorithm, we\\'ve embarked on a journey to bridge the gap between visual information and its narrative counterpart.

An embedding is a representation of some data object as a vector, constructed so that some properties of the data object are encoded into the geometric properties of its vector representation. That’s awfully abstract, but it’s not really as complicated as it sounds. First, we need to introduce a little (very little) bit of math. A vector is two things that sound like they're different but are actually the same: A vector is a point in a multidimensional space. A vector is an ordered list of scalar values, i.e., numbers. To see how this works, consider lists of two numbers. For example, ( 6 , 4 ) (6,4) and ( 2 , 8 ) (2,8). You see that we could treat them as coordinates on an x-y axis, with each list corresponding to a point in a two-dimensional space: If we have three numbers, like ( 3 , 2 , 5 ) (3,2,5) and ( 4 , 5 , 2 ) (4,5,2), then this corresponds to points in a three-dimensional space: The important point is that we could extend this into more dimensions: four, five, a hundred, a thousand, even millions or billions. Drawing a space with a thousand dimensions is very hard, and imagining one is all but impossible, but mathematically, it’s really easy. For example, the distance between points ( 6 , 4 ) (6,4) and ( 2 , 8 ) (2,8) is simply an application of Pythagoras’ theorem. Given two points 𝑎 = ( 𝑥 1 , 𝑦 1 ) a=(x 1 \\u200b ,y 1 \\u200b ) and 𝑏 = ( 𝑥 2 , 𝑦 2 ) b=(x 2 \\u200b ,y 2 \\u200b ), the distance between them is: For ( 6 , 4 ) (6,4) and ( 2 , 8 ) (2,8), this means: For three dimensions, we just extend the formula by adding a term. For 𝑎 = ( 3 , 2 , 5 ) a=(3,2,5) and 𝑏 = ( 4 , 5 , 2 ) b=(4,5,2): We can extend this formula to vectors in any number of dimensions. We just add more terms, the same way we did by going from two to three dimensions. Besides distance, another measurement we use in high-dimensional vector spaces is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. If you see each vector not just as a point but as a line from the origin (the point designated by the vector ( 0 , 0 , 0 , . . . ) (0,0,0,...)), then you can calculate the angle between the two vectors ( 𝜃 θ in the image below). To calculate this, we have another formula that scales up to any number of dimensions. We know that the cosine of the angle 𝜃 θ between vectors 𝑎 a and 𝑏 b is: This is more complicated than it looks, but not much. 𝑎 ⋅ 𝑏 a⋅b is called the dot product of the two vectors, and it’s easy to calculate. If 𝑎 = ( 3 , 2 , 5 ) a=(3,2,5) and 𝑏 = ( 4 , 5 , 2 ) b=(4,5,2), then: As for ‖ 𝑎 ‖ ‖a‖ and ‖ 𝑏 ‖ ‖b‖, those are the lengths of the vectors, i.e., the distance from the origin to that point.

We want something like this: To do that, we construct a neural network (which we’re going to call an embedding model) that takes 607,500 dimension vectors as input and outputs some other vector, typically with fewer dimensions. For example, the widely used ViT-B-32 image embedding model transforms input images into 512-dimension embedding vectors. We then train the embedding model with labeled pictures of apples and oranges, instructing it to adjust the network’s weights slowly to separate the embedding vectors for apples and oranges. After many cycles of training, we expect that when we give the model pictures of apples as input, it will output vectors that are closer to each other than they are to the vectors we get when we give it pictures of oranges as inputs. Those output vectors are embeddings, and they collectively form an embedding space. Individual embeddings’ locations encode useful information about their corresponding data objects: In this case, whether something is a picture of an apple or an orange. Telling apples from oranges is a very simplistic scenario, but you might easily imagine scaling it up to many features. In some use cases, we can even construct embeddings where we don’t explicitly say what features are relevant, and we let the neural network figure it out in the training process. For example, we can construct a face recognition system by taking pictures of people’s faces and training an embedding model to output embeddings that place pictures of the same person close together. We can then construct a database of people's pictures with their embedding vectors as keys. We would expect the stored faces to be distributed through the embedding space: We might expect that this embedding space would encode a lot of features that we had never explicitly trained it to encode. For example, it might segregate men from women: Or we might find people clustered together by features of their hair, like baldness or grey: But we would expect that if we gave it another picture of someone in the database, the embedding for that new picture would be closer to the picture we stored of that person than to anyone else: Of course, it would also find people who just look similar, although we hope that they wouldn’t be as close together as two people who are actually the same: This highlights the logic of embedding spaces:\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2498, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Embedding spaces can also support diverse input types, like text and images, creating a common embedding space and enabling you to map between the two. For example, if we have a database of pictures with descriptive captions, we can co-train two embedding models — one for images and one for texts — to output vectors in the same embedding space. The result is that embeddings of descriptions of images and embeddings of the images themselves will be near each other. In principle, any kind of digital data can serve as input for creating embeddings, and any paired data types — not just text and images — can serve to create multi-modal joint embedding spaces. What are embeddings good for? Like the Swiss Army knife, the question should be, what aren’t they good for?

But as the generative AI age progresses, it\\'s becoming clear that they\\'re more interconnected than we once believed. Search, in its most rigid form, can be seen as an overfitted version of creation, while creation, with its boundless potential, can be viewed as an underfitted form of search. PromptPerfect\\'s new feature is a nod to this interconnectedness, offering a seamless blend of both. Search is Overfitted Create; Create is Underfitted Search The biggest competition of neural search may come from a technology that doesn’t even need embeddings as an intermediate representation – an end-to-end technology that directly returns the result you want. How to use \"LLM as a Database\" Feature in PromptPerfect The beauty of the \"LLM as a database\" feature lies in its adaptability. Users can slide between the exactness of search and the novelty of creation, ensuring a tailored experience that meets specific needs. 0:00 / 1× PromptPerfect\\'s LLM as a database in action. Here\\'s a step-by-step breakdown of how users can navigate and leverage this feature: Accessing the Feature: Upon opening PromptPerfect, users can easily locate and click on the \"LLM as a database\" tab. Database Creation: Users are presented with the option to create a new database. Here, they can specify which backend LLM they wish to use. Whether it\\'s gpt3.5turbo, gpt4, claude2, llama2, or any other available model, the choice is at their fingertips. Data Import: Flexibility is key. Users can either bulk import their key-value pairs into the database or choose to manually add them one by one, catering to both large-scale and smaller, more specific projects. Deployment: Once satisfied with their database, users can deploy it in production. They have the option to make it public or keep it private, requiring a token for access. This ensures both accessibility and security, depending on the user\\'s preference. Querying the Database: The real magic happens here. Users can query their database using curl, Python, or Javascript through a straightforward API. If the queried key exists in the database, it returns the corresponding value. But the standout feature is its ability to interpolate when faced with an unfamiliar key. Instead of returning an error or a blank, the system intelligently draws from existing key-value pairs to generate and return a plausible value. This user-centric design ensures that while the technology behind \"LLM as a database\" is complex, interacting with it is straightforward and intuitive.

The \"LLM as a database\" feature introduced by PromptPerfect offers a unique perspective, and it\\'s essential to discern its place amidst the prevailing technologies. Few-shot Learning: Traditional few-shot learning operates on the principle of leveraging a limited set of examples to guide the model\\'s response generation. It\\'s a method that emphasizes the importance of context, allowing models to generate relevant outputs based on a handful of guiding examples. While powerful in its own right, few-shot learning is primarily context-driven. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG): At the other end of the spectrum, RAG employs external datastores to enrich the prompt, pulling from vast repositories of information to enhance the generated response. It\\'s a methodology that emphasizes comprehensive data retrieval, ensuring that the model\\'s outputs are informed by a wide array of external data. \"LLM as a Database\" - Striking a Balance: PromptPerfect\\'s \"LLM as a database\" feature can be visualized as occupying the middle ground between few-shot learning and RAG. It integrates the context-driven approach of few-shot learning with the data-rich capabilities of a database. Users can leverage the richness of key-value pairs for precise responses, while also benefiting from the model\\'s ability to interpolate and generate insights. Moreover, the architecture of \"LLM as a database\" holds the potential to transition towards a full RAG system, offering users the flexibility to harness extensive external datastores when needed. In essence, the \"LLM as a database\" feature doesn\\'t seek to replace or overshadow few-shot learning or RAG.

Members of the GPT family of closed-access models are not only expensive but also remotely hosted with unclear security. Ideally, we would like to have smaller but more specialized models that can give comparable performance to the large models but run on less expensive hardware that users can keep under their own control. This article is a step in that direction, demonstrating that it is feasible, and a way to do it inexpensively. More data vs. better data: Scaling factors in AI All else being equal, we know that the performance of an AI model depends on three scaling factors: Training time. Models trained for more cycles perform better than identical models trained for fewer on the same data. Data size. Models trained with more data perform better than identical models trained with less, given the same training time. Number of parameters, i.e., the size of the model. A model with more weights (or more neurons, which is the same thing) performs better than one with fewer, given the same training data and training time. To build a model with a smaller size but comparable performance to a larger one, we should, logically, use more data and more training cycles. But all else is not always equal. Data quality is a more difficult factor to quantify than training time, data size, or model size, but it makes a significant difference to performance. Intuitively, the model should learn better to solve a particular kind of problem if it learns from the most instructive examples. The problem with improving data quality is that it can be difficult or expensive to curate enough high-quality data to make a difference. Using AI models as both teacher and student One solution is to use AI models to create training data. This has the benefit of being much cheaper than commissioning humans to create enough data or paying them to curate existing data, picking out just the most relevant examples. At first glance, this seems counter-intuitive. If the model is already good enough to create high-quality training data to learn to solve a problem, then surely it can’t use this knowledge to improve its own performance. And this is true. But when the goal is to train a smaller, less capable AI to improve its performance, and we use a much more capable AI to create the training data, it makes just as much sense as a child learning to read from a teacher who is already literate. This is especially relevant to our goal of creating a smaller model with performance comparable to larger ones. We know that a smaller model will need more examples and more training time to reach the same result as a larger one, if it can reach it at all. What a 100 billion parameter model can learn from a thousand examples of sufficient quality might take a million equally high-quality examples for a 1 billion parameter model. The cost of human construction or curation of a million items of training data is a lot more than a thousand, no matter what the problem is.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3155, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Videos, in particular, have mushroomed into the bedrock of content consumption. From short-form social media clips to extensive webinars, the digital ecosystem is awash with moving pixels. And while the explosion of video content signals a seismic shift in how information is shared and consumed, it also presents an intricate challenge: the sheer volume of content and the immediacy of its consumption. The Search Dilemma: From Pixels to Text Think about it. Every video that gets uploaded is, in essence, a repository of information. But how do search engines understand them? Unlike text, videos don’t lend themselves easily to the parsing and indexing mechanisms that power the modern web. This is where video-to-text transcends from a luxury to a necessity. Translating videos into text allows search engines to index, categorize, and rank them, making content not just accessible but discoverable. The Skim Economy: Catering to the Impatient User Today’s user is not the reader of yesteryears; they're skimmers and scanners. Not everyone has the time (or inclination) to sit through a 30-minute video. A textual summary, however, can be skimmed in mere minutes. Video comprehension caters to this very demographic, ensuring content remains consumable for the fast-paced digital nomad. Skim reading is the new normal. The effect on society is profound | Maryanne Wolf When the reading brain skims texts, we don’t have time to grasp complexity, to understand another’s feelings or to perceive beauty. We need a new literacy for the digital age writes Maryanne Wolf, author of Reader, Come Home The Guardian Maryanne Wolf Accessibility: Bridging the Gap A core tenet of the modern web is inclusivity. While videos are an excellent medium for many, they inadvertently sideline those with visual or auditory impairments. Converting videos to text ensures that content is universally accessible, not just to a select few. Interested readers are strongly recommended to follow our efforts in using SceneXplain to improve digital accessibility in the EU.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.
