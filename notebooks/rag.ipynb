Specifically, this process can destroy long-distance contextual dependencies. In other words, when relevant information is spread across multiple chunks, taking text segments out of context can render them ineffective, making this approach particularly problematic. In the image below, a Wikipedia article is split into chunks of sentences. You can see that phrases like \"its\" and \"the city\" reference \"Berlin,\" which is mentioned only in the first sentence. This makes it harder for the embedding model to link these references to the correct entity, thereby producing a lower-quality vector representation. This means, if we split a long article into sentence-length chunks, as in the example above, a RAG system might struggle to answer a query like \"What is the population of Berlin?\" Because the city name and the population never appear together in a single chunk, and without any larger document context, an LLM presented with one of these chunks cannot resolve anaphoric references like \"it\" or \"the city.\" There are some heuristics to alleviate this issue, such as resampling with a sliding window, using multiple context window lengths, and performing multi-pass document scans. However, like all heuristics, these approaches are hit-or-miss; they may work in some cases, but there\\'s no theoretical guarantee of their effectiveness.

How to best place the wind turbines in a farm and also how to retrieve the electricity back to shore. We look at the main design drivers for offshore wind turbines and their components. We'll see how these aspects influence one another and the best choices to reduce the cost of energy. This course is organized by the two-delfd wind energy institute, an interfaculty research organization focusing specifically on wind energy. You will therefore benefit from the expertise of the lecturers in three different faculties of the university. Aerospace engineering, civil engineering and electrical engineering. Hi, my name is Ricardo Pareda. 3. Video-title: Systems Analysis for Problem Structuring part 1B the mono actor perspective example, transcript-segment: So let's assume the demarcation of the problem and the analysis of objectives has led to the identification of three criteria. The security of supply, the percentage of offshore power generation and the costs of energy provision. We now reason backwards to explore what factors have an influence on these system outcomes. Really, the offshore percentage is positively influenced by the installed Wind Power capacity at sea, a key system factor. Capacity at sea in turn is determined by both the size and the number of wind farms at sea. The Ministry of Economic Affairs cannot itself invest in new wind farms but hopes to simulate investors and energy companies by providing subsidies and by expediting the granting process of licenses as needed. Question: When was the first offshore wind farm commissioned? Answer: [/INST] Pass this prompt to the LLM endpoint — model_predictor — via the method model_predictor.predict(): answer = model_predictor.predict({\"inputs\": prompt_for_llm}) This returns a list, but since we only passed in one prompt, it will be a list with one entry. Each entry is a dict with the response text under the key generated_text: answer = answer[0]['generated_text'] print(answer) Result: The first offshore wind farm was commissioned in 1991. (Context: Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: Since the first offshore wind farm commissioned in 1991 in Denmark, ...) Let’s simplify querying by writing a function to do all the steps: taking the string question as a parameter and returning the answer as a string: def ask_rag(question): search_results = find_most_similar_transcript_segment(question) reranked_results = rerank_results(search_results, question) prompt_for_llm = prompt_template.substitute( question = question, title_1 = search_results[0][0], segment_1 = search_results[0][1], title_2 = search_results[1][0], segment_2 = search_results[1][1], title_3 = search_results[2][0], segment_3 = search_results[2][1], ) answer = model_predictor.predict({\"inputs\": prompt_for_llm}) return answer[0][\"generated_text\"] Now we can ask it a few more questions. Answers will depend on the content of the video transcripts. For example, we can ask detailed questions when the answer is present in the data and get an answer: ask_rag(\"What is a Kaplan Meyer estimator?\") The Kaplan Meyer estimator is a non-parametric estimator for the survival function, defined for both censored and not censored data. It is represented as a series of declining horizontal steps that approaches the truths of the survival function if the sample size is sufficiently large enough. The value of the empirical survival function obtained is assumed to be constant between two successive distinct observations. ask_rag(\"Who is Reneville Solingen?\") Reneville Solingen is a professor at Delft University of Technology in Global Software Engineering.\n",

      "Hyperparameters of ColBERT The hyperparameters of ColBERT is summarized below: Hyperparameter Best Choice Reason Learning Rate 3 x 10^{-6} Selected for fine-tuning to ensure stable and effective model updates. Batch Size 32 Balances computational efficiency and the ability to capture sufficient information per update. Number of Embeddings per Query (Nq) 32 Fixed to ensure a consistent representation size across queries, aiding in efficient processing. Embedding Dimension (m) 128 Demonstrated to provide a good balance between representational power and computational efficiency. Training Iterations 200k (MS MARCO), 125k (TREC CAR) Chosen to ensure thorough learning while avoiding overfitting, with adjustments based on dataset characteristics. Bytes per Dimension in Embeddings 4 (re-ranking), 2 (end-to-end ranking) Trade-off between precision and space efficiency, with consideration for the application context (re-ranking vs. end-to-end). Vector-Similarity Function Cosine (re-ranking), (Squared) L2 (end-to-end) Selected based on performance and efficiency in the respective retrieval contexts. FAISS Index Partitions (P) 2000 Determines the granularity of the search space partitioning, impacting search efficiency. Nearest Partitions Searched (p) 10 Balances the breadth of the search against computational efficiency. Sub-vectors per Embedding (s) 16 Affects the granularity of quantization, influencing both search speed and memory usage. Index Representation per Dimension 16-bit values Chosen for the second stage of end-to-end retrieval to manage the trade-off between accuracy and space. Number of Layers in Encoders 12-layer BERT Optimal balance between depth of contextual understanding and computational efficiency. Max Query Length 128 The maximum number of tokens processed by the query encoder. This gets extended in Jina-ColBERT model. Max Document Length 512 The maximum number of tokens processed by the document encoder. This gets extended to 8192 in Jina-ColBERT model. The indexing strategy of ColBERT Unlike representation-based approaches that encode each document into one embedding vector, ColBERT encodes documents (and queries) into bags of embeddings, with each token in a document having its own embedding. This approach inherently means that for longer documents, more embeddings will be stored, which is a pain point of the original ColBERT, and later addressed by ColBERTv2. The key to managing this efficiently lies in ColBERT's use of vector database (e.g. FAISS) for indexing and retrieval, and its detailed indexing process which is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently. The original ColBERT paper mentions several strategies to enhance the efficiency of indexing and retrieval, including: Offline Indexing: Document representations are computed offline, allowing for the pre-computation and storage of document embeddings. This process leverages batch processing and GPU acceleration to handle large document collections efficiently. Embedding Storage: Document embeddings can be stored using 32-bit or 16-bit values for each dimension, offering a trade-off between precision and storage requirements. This flexibility allows ColBERT to maintain a balance between effectiveness (in terms of retrieval performance) and efficiency (in terms of storage and computational costs). The introduction of residual compression in ColBERTv2, which is a novel approach not present in the original ColBERT, plays a key role in reducing the model's space footprint by 6–10× while preserving quality. This technique compresses the embeddings further by effectively capturing and storing only the differences from a set of fixed reference centroids. Effectiveness and Efficiency of ColBERT One might initially assume that incorporating BERT's deep contextual understanding into search would inherently require significant computational resources, making such an approach less feasible for real-time applications due to high latency and computational costs. However, ColBERT challenges and overturns this assumption through its innovative use of the late interaction mechanism. Here are some noteworthy points: Significant Efficiency Gains: ColBERT achieves an orders-of-magnitude reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and latency compared to traditional BERT-based ranking models. Specifically, for a given model size (e.g., 12-layer \"base\" transformer encoder), ColBERT not only matches but in some cases exceeds the effectiveness of BERT-based models with dramatically lower computational demands. For instance, at a re-ranking depth of k=10, BERT requires nearly 180× more FLOPs than ColBERT; this gap widens as k increases, reaching 13900× at k=1000 and even 23000× at k=2000​​. Improved Recall and MRR@10 in End-to-End Retrieval: Contrary to the initial intuition that deeper interaction between query and document representations (as seen in early interaction models) would be necessary for high retrieval performance, ColBERT's end-to-end retrieval setup demonstrates superior effectiveness.\n",

      "Contrastive Learning and the False Negative Problem Liang et al. [2022] also discovered that standard contrastive learning practices — the mechanism we use to train CLIP-style multimodal models — tend to reinforce the multimodal gap. Contrastive learning is fundamentally a simple concept. We have an image embedding and a text embedding and we know they should be closer together, so we adjust the weights in the model during training to do that. We go slowly, adjusting the weights by a small amount, and we adjust them in proportion to how far apart the two embeddings are: Closer together means a smaller change than farther apart. This technique works much better if we don’t just bring embeddings closer together when they match, but also move them further apart when they don’t match. We want to have not just image-text pairs that belong together, we want pairs that we know belong apart. This poses some problems: Our data sources consist entirely of matching pairs. No one would make a database of texts and images that a human has verified are unrelated, nor could you readily construct one by scraping the web or some other unsupervised or semi-supervised technique. Even image-text pairs that superficially seem completely disjoint aren’t necessarily so. We don’t have a theory of semantics that allows us to objectively make such negative judgments. For example, a picture of a cat lying on a porch is not a completely negative match for the text “a man sleeping on a sofa.” Both involve lying on something. We would ideally want to train with image-text pairs that we knew with certainty were related and unrelated, but there is no obvious way to get known unrelated pairs. It’s possible to ask people “Does this sentence describe this picture?” and expect consistent answers. It’s much harder to get consistent answers from asking “Does this sentence have nothing to do with this picture?” Instead, we get unrelated image-text pairs by randomly selecting pictures and texts from our training data, expecting they will practically always be bad matches. How this works in practice is that we divide our training data into batches. To train Jina CLIP, we used batches containing 32,000 matching image-text pairs, but for this experiment, batch sizes were only 16.\n",

Kipf A Toy Implementation of Graph Embeddings Implementing graph embedding techniques from scratch can be challenging. The algorithm below shows a simple way to generate graph embeddings. It takes an adjacency matrix as input, which represents the connections in a graph. Each row and column corresponds to a node, and a 1 indicates an edge between those nodes. from typing import List import numpy as np def graph_embedding(adj_matrix: List[List[int]], emb_size: int = 16) -> List[np.ndarray]: \"\"\"Generate graph embedding Args: adj_matrix: Adjacency matrix as nested list emb_size: Size of embedding vectors Returns: List of numpy arrays as node embeddings \"\"\" # Initialize empty embeddings embeddings = [np.random.rand(emb_size) for _ in adj_matrix] # Train embedding -visualize nodes moving closer if connected for _ in range(100): for v1, row in enumerate(adj_matrix): for v2, is_connected in enumerate(row): if is_connected: # Move embeddings closer if nodes connected embeddings[v1] -= 0.1 * (embeddings[v1] - embeddings[v2]) return embeddings It initializes an embedding vector of random values for each node. Then it trains these embeddings by iterating through the adjacency matrix to identify connected nodes. For any pair of nodes that are connected, it moves their embedding vectors slightly closer together. This is done by subtracting a fraction of their vector difference from the first node's embedding. Over multiple iterations, nodes that are tightly interconnected will have very similar embedding vectors, while disconnected nodes will remain far apart in the embedding space. The for _ in range(100) loop controls the number of training iterations. More iterations allow the embeddings to converge closer to their optimal values for representing the graph structure. Finally, the embeddings are returned as a list of numpy arrays. Each array is the vector representation for a node.\n",

      "The models we will use are Jina Embeddings v2 - English, Jina Reranker v1, and the Mistral-7B-Instruct large language model. You can also follow along with a Python Notebook, which you can download or run on Google Colab. Retrieval-Augmented Generation Retrieval-augmented generation is an alternative paradigm in generative AI. Instead of using large language models (LLMs) to directly answer user requests with what it’s learned in training, it takes advantage of their fluent language production while relocating logic and information retrieval to an external apparatus better suited to it. Before invoking an LLM, RAG systems actively retrieve relevant information from some external data source and then feed it to the LLM as part of its prompt. The role of the LLM is to synthesize outside information into a coherent response to user requests, minimizing the risk of hallucination and increasing the relevance and usefulness of the result. A RAG system schematically has at least four components: A data source, typically a vector database of some kind, suited to AI-assisted information retrieval. An information retrieval system that treats the user’s request as a query, and retrieves data that is relevant to answering it. A system, often including an AI-based reranker, that selects some of the retrieved data and processes it into a prompt for an LLM. An LLM, for example one of the GPT models or an open-source LLM like Mistral’s, that takes the user request and the data provided to it and generates a response for the user. Embedding models are well-suited for information retrieval and are often used for that purpose. A text embedding model takes texts as inputs and outputs an embedding — a high-dimensional vector — whose spatial relationship to other embeddings is indicative of their semantic similarity, i.e. similar topics, contents, and related meanings. They are often used in information retrieval because the closer the embeddings, the more likely the user will be happy with the response. They are also relatively easy to fine-tune to improve their performance in specific domains. Text reranker models use similar AI principles to compare collections of texts to a query and sort them by their semantic similarity. Using a task-specific reranker model, instead of relying on just an embedding model, often dramatically increases the precision of search results. The reranker in a RAG application selects some of the results of information retrieval in order to maximize the probability that the right information is in the prompt to the LLM.

Our new model improves the accuracy and relevance by 20% over simple vector search. Try it now for free! Benchmarking Performance of Embedding Models as SageMaker Endpoints We tested the performance and reliability of the Jina Embeddings v2 Base - English model as a SageMaker endpoint, running on a g4dn.xlarge instance. In these experiments, we continuously spawned one new user every second, each of whom would send a request, wait for its response, and repeat upon receiving it. For requests of less than 100 tokens, for up to 150 concurrent users, the response times per request stayed below 100ms. Then, the response times increased linearly from 100ms to 1500ms with the spawning of more concurrent users. At about 300 concurrent users, we received more than 5 failures from the API and ended the test. For requests between 1K and 8K tokens, for up to 20 concurrent users, the response times per request stayed below 8s. Then, the response times increased linearly from 8s to 60s with the spawning of more concurrent users. At about 140 concurrent users, we received more than 5 failures from the API and ended the test. Performance during test runs (left: small context, right: large context), showing the effect of increasing users over time on response times and failure rates. Based on these results, we can conclude that for most users with normal embedding workloads g4dn.xlarge or g5.xlarge instances should meet their daily needs.

We introduce the \"Late Chunking\" that leverages long-context embedding models to generate contextual chunk embeddings for better retrieval applications. Michael Günther, Han Xiao • 8 minutes read About a year ago, in October 2023, we released the world's first open-source embedding model with an 8K context length, jina-embeddings-v2-base-en. Since then, there has been quite some debate about the usefulness of long-context in embedding models. For many applications, encoding a document thousands of words long into a single embedding representation is not ideal. Many use cases require retrieving smaller portions of the text, and dense vector-based retrieval systems often perform better with smaller text segments, as the semantics are less likely to be \"over-compressed\" in the embedding vectors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the most well-known applications that requires splitting documents into smaller text chunks (say within 512 tokens). These chunks are usually stored in a vector database, with vector representations generated by a text embedding model. During runtime, the same embedding model encodes a query into a vector representation, which is then used to identify relevant stored text chunks. These chunks are subsequently passed to a large language model (LLM), which synthesizes a response to the query based on the retrieved texts. A typical RAG pipeline of chunking-embedding-retrieving-generating. In short, embedding smaller chunks seems to be more preferable, partly due to the limited input sizes of downstream LLMs, but also because there’s a concern that important contextual information in a long context may get diluted when compressed into a single vector. But if the industry only ever needs embedding models with a 512-context length, what’s the point of training models with an 8192-context length at all? In this article, we revisit this important, albeit uncomfortable, question by exploring the limitations of the naive chunking-embedding pipeline in RAG.

      "Contrastive Learning and the False Negative Problem Liang et al. [2022] also discovered that standard contrastive learning practices — the mechanism we use to train CLIP-style multimodal models — tend to reinforce the multimodal gap. Contrastive learning is fundamentally a simple concept. We have an image embedding and a text embedding and we know they should be closer together, so we adjust the weights in the model during training to do that. We go slowly, adjusting the weights by a small amount, and we adjust them in proportion to how far apart the two embeddings are: Closer together means a smaller change than farther apart. This technique works much better if we don’t just bring embeddings closer together when they match, but also move them further apart when they don’t match. We want to have not just image-text pairs that belong together, we want pairs that we know belong apart. This poses some problems: Our data sources consist entirely of matching pairs. No one would make a database of texts and images that a human has verified are unrelated, nor could you readily construct one by scraping the web or some other unsupervised or semi-supervised technique. Even image-text pairs that superficially seem completely disjoint aren’t necessarily so. We don’t have a theory of semantics that allows us to objectively make such negative judgments. For example, a picture of a cat lying on a porch is not a completely negative match for the text “a man sleeping on a sofa.” Both involve lying on something. We would ideally want to train with image-text pairs that we knew with certainty were related and unrelated, but there is no obvious way to get known unrelated pairs. It’s possible to ask people “Does this sentence describe this picture?” and expect consistent answers. It’s much harder to get consistent answers from asking “Does this sentence have nothing to do with this picture?” Instead, we get unrelated image-text pairs by randomly selecting pictures and texts from our training data, expecting they will practically always be bad matches. How this works in practice is that we divide our training data into batches. To train Jina CLIP, we used batches containing 32,000 matching image-text pairs, but for this experiment, batch sizes were only 16.\n",

Kipf A Toy Implementation of Graph Embeddings Implementing graph embedding techniques from scratch can be challenging. The algorithm below shows a simple way to generate graph embeddings. It takes an adjacency matrix as input, which represents the connections in a graph. Each row and column corresponds to a node, and a 1 indicates an edge between those nodes. from typing import List import numpy as np def graph_embedding(adj_matrix: List[List[int]], emb_size: int = 16) -> List[np.ndarray]: \"\"\"Generate graph embedding Args: adj_matrix: Adjacency matrix as nested list emb_size: Size of embedding vectors Returns: List of numpy arrays as node embeddings \"\"\" # Initialize empty embeddings embeddings = [np.random.rand(emb_size) for _ in adj_matrix] # Train embedding -visualize nodes moving closer if connected for _ in range(100): for v1, row in enumerate(adj_matrix): for v2, is_connected in enumerate(row): if is_connected: # Move embeddings closer if nodes connected embeddings[v1] -= 0.1 * (embeddings[v1] - embeddings[v2]) return embeddings It initializes an embedding vector of random values for each node. Then it trains these embeddings by iterating through the adjacency matrix to identify connected nodes. For any pair of nodes that are connected, it moves their embedding vectors slightly closer together. This is done by subtracting a fraction of their vector difference from the first node's embedding. Over multiple iterations, nodes that are tightly interconnected will have very similar embedding vectors, while disconnected nodes will remain far apart in the embedding space. The for _ in range(100) loop controls the number of training iterations. More iterations allow the embeddings to converge closer to their optimal values for representing the graph structure. Finally, the embeddings are returned as a list of numpy arrays. Each array is the vector representation for a node.\n",

Research Trends Interest in a wide array of topics, but no standout groundbreaking papers. Shift towards LLM interpretability, ethics, agents, and multimodal reasoning. Conference Atmosphere A bit peculiar and pessimistic due to the release of ChatGPT and its implications on traditional NLP methods. More confidence and adaptability among researchers in embracing new trends. Research Diversity Still exploring traditional methods like topic modeling, n-grams smoothing, and Bayesian methods (as seen in COLING 2022). Rapid adaptation to newer approaches, moving away from older methods. Relevance of Presented Work Consistent with contemporary research trends at the time. Fast-paced AI development made some empirical methods and results feel outdated by the time of the conference. Conference Engagement Enjoyment derived more from personal conversations and interactions than from paper presentations. Increased focus on personal communication, with more time spent at poster sessions than listening to oral presentations. Paper Highlights from EMNLP 2023 At EMNLP 2023, several intriguing papers caught my attention, each addressing different aspects of NLP and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this field. Let me share some of the highlights from these papers and my thoughts on them. Hybrid Inverted Index Is a Robust Accelerator for Dense Retrieval Hybrid Inverted Index Is a Robust Accelerator for Dense Retrieval Inverted file structure is a common technique for accelerating dense retrieval. It clusters documents based on their embeddings; during searching, it probes nearby clusters w.r.t. an input query and only evaluates documents within them by subsequent codecs, thus avoiding the expensive cost of exhaustive traversal. However, the clustering is always lossy, which results in the miss of relevant documents in the probed clusters and hence degrades retrieval quality. In contrast, lexical matching, such as overlaps of salient terms, tends to be strong feature for identifying relevant documents. In this work, we present the Hybrid Inverted Index (HI 2 2 ), where the embedding clusters and salient terms work collaboratively to accelerate dense retrieval. To make best of both effectiveness and efficiency, we devise a cluster selector and a term selector, to construct compact inverted lists and efficiently searching through them. Moreover, we leverage simple unsupervised algorithms as well as end-to-end knowledge distillation to learn these two modules, with the latter further boosting the effectiveness. Based on comprehensive experiments on popular retrieval benchmarks, we verify that clusters and terms indeed complement each other, enabling HI 2 2 to achieve lossless retrieval quality with competitive efficiency across various index settings. Our code and checkpoint are publicly available at https://github.com/namespace-Pt/Adon/tree/HI2.\n",

      "Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi’s inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark. arXiv.org Ofir Press Instead, this paper addresses this problem by introducing a new method that allows one to fine-tune an exciting language model to apply it to longer context lengths. To achieve this, the model's vocabulary is extended by a fixed number of summary tokens, which are supposed to tell the model to summarize the content of the other tokens in the respective embeddings. During inference, the text input is segmented into shorter text sequences which are extended with the summary tokens and prepended with the output summary vectors of the previously processed segments. To fine-tune the model to handle long sequences, the model is trained on a next-token prediction task. Thereby, the model should make use of the information encoded in the summary embeddings of the previous segments. Notably, the segment length is varied during the training and the backpropagation is done for one document as a whole. In other words, the model is first applied to all sequences in the afore-described scheme before starting the backpropagation. The technique is evaluated by the authors on OPT models of various sizes and the 7-B-Llama-2 model. Besides standard language modeling tasks, the authors also show that the models can be effectively used to solve in-context-learning classification tasks with longer prompts or used for re-ranking. Here the re-ranking follows a language modeling approach in which the passages are re-ranked based on the language model’s likelihood to generate the question from the given passage.

One such prevailing discourse is the perceived necessity for a dedicated \"vector store\" or \"vector database\" in the modern AI stack. This notion is propelled by the increasing application of deep neural networks to search, leading many to believe that managing a vast number of dense vectors demands a specialized store.

They covered a breadth of topics, from the evolution of embeddings to their future in a world increasingly dominated by Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Key Takeaways from the Panel Diverse Perspectives on Embeddings: The panelists introduced themselves and their work with various embeddings, discussing the common threads and divergences they've observed. They emphasized the nuanced differences in how embeddings behave depending on their design and application contexts. The Relevance of Embeddings Amidst Generative AI: With 2023's spotlight on LLMs, the panelists reflected on the enduring importance of embeddings. They highlighted that despite the LLM trend, embeddings retain a crucial role in understanding and processing language at a more granular level. Context Length in Embeddings vs. LLMs: A curious observation was the disparity in context length expansion between LLMs and embedding models. The panelists shed light on the technical and practical constraints that currently limit the context window in embedding models. Search and Generation: Addressing the assertion that 'search is an overfitted generation, and generation is an underfitted search,' the panelists shared mixed views, sparking a lively debate on the interplay between search functions and generative capabilities.

Han Xiao • 4 minutes read In the rapidly shifting landscape of technology, it's all too easy to be ensnared by the latest buzzwords and narratives. One such prevailing discourse is the perceived necessity for a dedicated \"vector store\" or \"vector database\" in the modern AI stack. This notion is propelled by the increasing application of deep neural networks to search, leading many to believe that managing a vast number of dense vectors demands a specialized store.

      "The answer should only use the presented context. If the question cannot be answered based on the context, say so. Context: 1. Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: Since the first offshore wind farm commissioned in 1991 in Denmark, scientists and engineers have adapted and improved the technology of wind energy to offshore conditions. This is a rapidly evolving field with installation of increasingly larger wind turbines in deeper waters. At sea, the challenges are indeed numerous, with combined wind and wave loads, reduced accessibility and uncertain-solid conditions. My name is Axel Vire, I'm an assistant professor in Wind Energy at U-Delf and specializing in offshore wind energy. This course will touch upon the critical aspect of wind energy, how to integrate the various engineering disciplines involved in offshore wind energy. Each week we will focus on a particular discipline and use it to design and operate a wind farm. 2. Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: For example, we look at how to characterize the wind and wave conditions at a given location. How to best place the wind turbines in a farm and also how to retrieve the electricity back to shore. We look at the main design drivers for offshore wind turbines and their components. We'll see how these aspects influence one another and the best choices to reduce the cost of energy. This course is organized by the two-delfd wind energy institute, an interfaculty research organization focusing specifically on wind energy. You will therefore benefit from the expertise of the lecturers in three different faculties of the university. Aerospace engineering, civil engineering and electrical engineering. Hi, my name is Ricardo Pareda. 3. Video-title: Systems Analysis for Problem Structuring part 1B the mono actor perspective example, transcript-segment: So let's assume the demarcation of the problem and the analysis of objectives has led to the identification of three criteria. The security of supply, the percentage of offshore power generation and the costs of energy provision. We now reason backwards to explore what factors have an influence on these system outcomes. Really, the offshore percentage is positively influenced by the installed Wind Power capacity at sea, a key system factor. Capacity at sea in turn is determined by both the size and the number of wind farms at sea. The Ministry of Economic Affairs cannot itself invest in new wind farms but hopes to simulate investors and energy companies by providing subsidies and by expediting the granting process of licenses as needed. Question: When was the first offshore wind farm commissioned? Answer: [/INST] Pass this prompt to the LLM endpoint — model_predictor — via the method model_predictor.predict(): answer = model_predictor.predict({\"inputs\": prompt_for_llm}) This returns a list, but since we only passed in one prompt, it will be a list with one entry. Each entry is a dict with the response text under the key generated_text: answer = answer[0]['generated_text'] print(answer) Result: The first offshore wind farm was commissioned in 1991. (Context: Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: Since the first offshore wind farm commissioned in 1991 in Denmark, ...) Let’s simplify querying by writing a function to do all the steps: taking the string question as a parameter and returning the answer as a string: def ask_rag(question): search_results = find_most_similar_transcript_segment(question) reranked_results = rerank_results(search_results, question) prompt_for_llm = prompt_template.substitute( question = question, title_1 = search_results[0][0], segment_1 = search_results[0][1], title_2 = search_results[1][0], segment_2 = search_results[1][1], title_3 = search_results[2][0], segment_3 = search_results[2][1], ) answer = model_predictor.predict({\"inputs\": prompt_for_llm}) return answer[0][\"generated_text\"] Now we can ask it a few more questions. Answers will depend on the content of the video transcripts. For example, we can ask detailed questions when the answer is present in the data and get an answer: ask_rag(\"What is a Kaplan Meyer estimator?\") The Kaplan Meyer estimator is a non-parametric estimator for the survival function, defined for both censored and not censored data. It is represented as a series of declining horizontal steps that approaches the truths of the survival function if the sample size is sufficiently large enough. The value of the empirical survival function obtained is assumed to be constant between two successive distinct observations. ask_rag(\"Who is Reneville Solingen?\") Reneville Solingen is a professor at Delft University of Technology in Global Software Engineering.\n",

Fine-tuning StarCoder 1B StarCoder 1B is a one-billion-parameter model from a family of pre-trained models designed to perform programming tasks in multiple programming languages. It was pre-trained on The Stack dataset, a collection of code items from GitHub with permissive licenses. We did full parameter fine-tuning using the synthetic dataset described above, with a batch size of 128 and a micro-batch size of 8. Our training hardware was a RunPod cloud instance with an NVIDIA A40 GPU. 💡 The fine-tuning compute cost, using a cloud-based rented GPU, was approximately 10 USD. This compares very favorably to the cost of fine-tuning OpenAI’s closed-access GPT models or the larger open-access models like Llama 2. We have made the entire weight set of our fine-tuned StarCoder 1B available as a HuggingFace model. You are free to download, use, and retrain it. jinaai/starcoder-1b-textbook · Hugging Face We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science. Evaluation To evaluate our training, we used the standard HumanEval benchmark (Chen et al. 2021). This benchmark consists of 164 human-made programming problems written in English and a set of Python unit tests to verify that a proposed solution correctly solves the problem. For example, we gave our fine-tuned model the following prompt from HumanEval: from typing import List, Optional def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]: \"\"\" Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty. >>> longest([]) >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c']) 'a' >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc']) 'ccc' \"\"\" The modified StarCoder 1B produced as output: from typing import List, Optional def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]: \"\"\" Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty. >>> longest([]) >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c']) 'a' >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc']) 'ccc' \"\"\" if not strings: return None longest_string = strings[0] for string in strings[1:]: if len(string) > len(longest_string): longest_string = string return longest_string This function passes all the unit tests for finding the longest string in a list of strings and is therefore marked as successful. Our fine-tuned StarCoder 1B is also able to handle more abstract problems that can involve world knowledge. For example, it generated the code for this function from the text docstring description. The actual number-to-letter maps for Roman numeral conversion were not provided in the prompt: def int_to_mini_roman(number): \"\"\" Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string, and return it in lowercase.

      "What is it, and where does it come from? Bo Wang,Scott Martens • 13 minutes read Semantic embeddings are the core of modern AI models, even chatbots and AI art models. They’re sometimes hidden from users, but they’re still there, lurking just under the surface. The theory of embeddings has only two parts: Things — things outside of an AI model, like texts and images — are represented by vectors created by AI models from data about those things. Relationships between things outside of an AI model are represented by spatial relations between those vectors. We train AI models specifically to create vectors that work that way. When we make an image-text multimodal model, we train the model so that embeddings of pictures and embeddings of texts describing or related to those pictures are relatively close together. The semantic similarities between the things those two vectors represent — an image and a text — are reflected in the spatial relationship between the two vectors. For example, we might reasonably expect the embedding vectors for an image of an orange and the text “a fresh orange” to be closer together than the same image and the text “a fresh apple.” That’s the purpose of an embedding model: To generate representations where the characteristics we care about — like what kind of fruit is depicted in an image or named in a text — are preserved in the distance between them. But multimodality introduces something else. We might find that a picture of an orange is closer to a picture of an apple than it is to the text “a fresh orange”, and that the text “a fresh apple” is closer to another text than to an image of an apple. It turns out this is exactly what happens with multimodal models, including Jina AI’s own Jina CLIP model (jina-clip-v1). Jina CLIP: Your CLIP Model Is Also Your Text Retriever\n",

      "When applying late chunking to the Wikipedia example above, you can immediately see an improvement in semantic similarity. For instance, in the case of \"the city\" and \"Berlin\" within a Wikipedia article, the vectors representing \"the city\" now contain information linking it to the previous mention of \"Berlin,\" making it a much better match for queries involving that city name. Query Chunk Sim. on naive chunking Sim. on late chunking Berlin Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany, both by area and by population. 0.849 0.850 Berlin Its more than 3.85 million inhabitants make it the European Union's most populous city, as measured by population within city limits. 0.708 0.825 Berlin The city is also one of the states of Germany, and is the third smallest state in the country in terms of area. 0.753 0.850 You can observe this in the numerical results above, which compare the embedding of the term \"Berlin\" to various sentences from the article about Berlin using cosine similarity. The column \"Sim. on IID chunk embeddings\" shows the similarity values between the query embedding of \"Berlin\" and the embeddings using a priori chunking, while \"Sim. under contextual chunk embedding\" represents the results with late chunking method. Quantitative Evaluation on BEIR To verify the effectiveness of late chunking beyond a toy example, we tested it using some of the retrieval benchmarks from BeIR. These retrieval tasks consist of a query set, a corpus of text documents, and a QRels file that stores information about the IDs of documents relevant to each query. To identify the relevant documents for a query, the documents are chunked, encoded into an embedding index, and the most similar chunks are determined for each query embedding using k-nearest neighbors (kNN). Since each chunk corresponds to a document, the kNN ranking of chunks can be converted into a kNN ranking of documents (retaining only the first occurrence for documents appearing multiple times in the ranking). This resulting ranking is then compared to the ranking provided by the ground-truth QRels file, and retrieval metrics like nDCG@10 are calculated.\n",

      "Given that ColBERTv2's architecture remains very similar to that of the original ColBERT, with its key innovations revolving around training techniques and compression mechanisms, we will first delve into the foundational aspects of the original ColBERT. What is late interaction in ColBERT? \"Interaction\" refers to the process of evaluating the relevance between a query and a document by comparing their representations. \"Late interaction\" is the essence of ColBERT. The term is derived from the model's architecture and processing strategy, where the interaction between the query and document representations occurs late in the process, after both have been independently encoded. This contrasts with \"early interaction\" models, where query and document embeddings interact at earlier stages, typically before or during their encoding by the model. Interaction Type Models Early Interaction BERT, ANCE, DPR, Sentence-BERT, DRMM, KNRM, Conv-KNRM, etc. Late Interaction ColBERT, ColBERTv2 Early interaction can increase computational complexity since it requires considering all possible query-document pairs, making it less efficient for large-scale applications. Late interaction models like ColBERT optimize for efficiency and scalability by allowing for the pre-computation of document representations and employing a more lightweight interaction step at the end, which focuses on the already encoded representations. This design choice enables faster retrieval times and reduced computational demands, making it more suitable for processing large document collections. Schematic diagrams illustrating query–document interaction paradigms in neural IR, with ColBERT's late interaction on the left-most. No interaction: cosine similarity of document and query embeddings Many practical vector databases and neural search solutions depend on fast cosine similarity matching between document and query embeddings. While appealing for its straightforwardness and computational efficiency, this method, often referred to as \"no interaction\" or \"not interaction-based\" has been found to underperform in comparison to models that incorporate some form of interaction between queries and documents. The core limitation of the \"no interaction\" approach lies in its inability to capture the complex nuances and relationships between query and document terms. Information retrieval, at its heart, is about understanding and matching the intent behind a query with the content within a document. This process often requires a deep, contextual understanding of the terms involved, something that single, aggregated embeddings for documents and queries struggle to provide. Query and document encoders in ColBERT ColBERT's encoding strategy is grounded in the BERT model, known for its deep contextual understanding of language. The model generates dense vector representations for each token in a query or document, creating a bag of contextualized embeddings for a query and a bag for a document, respectively. This facilitates a nuanced comparison of their embeddings during the late interaction phase. Query encoder of ColBERT For a query 𝑄 Q with tokens 𝑞 1 , 𝑞 2 , . . . , 𝑞 𝑙 q 1 ​ ,q 2 ​ ,...,q l ​ , the process begins by tokenizing 𝑄 Q into BERT-based WordPiece tokens and prepending a special [Q] token. This [Q] token, positioned right after BERT’s [CLS] token, signals the start of a query. If the query is shorter than a predefined number of tokens 𝑁 𝑞 N q ​ , it is padded with [mask] tokens up to 𝑁 𝑞 N q ​ ; otherwise, it's truncated to the first 𝑁 𝑞 N q ​ tokens. The padded sequence is then passed through BERT, followed by a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and normalization. The output is a set of embedding vectors termed as 𝐸 𝑞 E q ​ below: 𝐸 𝑞 : = N o r m a l i z e ( B E R T ( [ 𝑄 ] , 𝑞 0 , 𝑞 1 , … , 𝑞 𝑙 [ 𝑚 𝑎 𝑠 𝑘 ] , [ 𝑚 𝑎 𝑠 𝑘 ] , … , [ 𝑚 𝑎 𝑠 𝑘 ] ) ) E q ​ :=Normalize(BERT([Q],q 0 ​ ,q 1 ​ ,…,q l ​ [mask],[mask],…,[mask])) Document encoder of ColBERT Similarly, for a document 𝐷 D with tokens 𝑑 1 , 𝑑 2 , . . . , 𝑑 𝑛 d 1 ​ ,d 2 ​ ,...,d n ​ , a [D] token is prepended to indicate the start of a document.\n",

We did full parameter fine-tuning using the synthetic dataset described above, with a batch size of 128 and a micro-batch size of 8. Our training hardware was a RunPod cloud instance with an NVIDIA A40 GPU. 💡 The fine-tuning compute cost, using a cloud-based rented GPU, was approximately 10 USD. This compares very favorably to the cost of fine-tuning OpenAI’s closed-access GPT models or the larger open-access models like Llama 2. We have made the entire weight set of our fine-tuned StarCoder 1B available as a HuggingFace model. You are free to download, use, and retrain it. jinaai/starcoder-1b-textbook · Hugging Face We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science. Evaluation To evaluate our training, we used the standard HumanEval benchmark (Chen et al. 2021). This benchmark consists of 164 human-made programming problems written in English and a set of Python unit tests to verify that a proposed solution correctly solves the problem. For example, we gave our fine-tuned model the following prompt from HumanEval: from typing import List, Optional def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]: \"\"\" Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty. >>> longest([]) >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c']) 'a' >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc']) 'ccc' \"\"\" The modified StarCoder 1B produced as output: from typing import List, Optional def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]: \"\"\" Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty. >>> longest([]) >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c']) 'a' >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc']) 'ccc' \"\"\" if not strings: return None longest_string = strings[0] for string in strings[1:]: if len(string) > len(longest_string): longest_string = string return longest_string This function passes all the unit tests for finding the longest string in a list of strings and is therefore marked as successful. Our fine-tuned StarCoder 1B is also able to handle more abstract problems that can involve world knowledge. For example, it generated the code for this function from the text docstring description. The actual number-to-letter maps for Roman numeral conversion were not provided in the prompt: def int_to_mini_roman(number): \"\"\" Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string, and return it in lowercase. Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000 Examples: >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix' >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii' >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi' \"\"\" roman_numerals = { 1000: 'M', 900: 'CM', 500: 'D', 400: 'CD', 100: 'C', 90: 'XC', 50: 'L', 40: 'XL', 10: 'X', 9: 'IX', 5: 'V', 4: 'IV', 1: 'I' } roman_numeral = \"\" for value, symbol in roman_numerals.items(): while number >= value: roman_numeral += symbol number -= value return roman_numeral.lower()\n",

      "Jina AI • 8 minutes read In the grand canvas of technology, AI, with its large models, looms large. We're not just talking about computers that can play chess or identify photos; we're looking at machines that skirt the edge of what we might call 'thinking'. They can chat, they can craft text, they might even surprise you with a poem if you ask nicely. We're living in a world where our AI tools aren't just tools anymore. They're almost colleagues. There's a ballpark figure floating around, suggesting that these generative AI models could inject a few trillion dollars into the world economy annually. That's not pocket change. But here's the hitch. If a computer is becoming more like a human, then it's inheriting all our quirks. Our brilliance, our creativity, yes, but also our biases and blind spots. This isn’t just about AI becoming smart; it’s about AI becoming wise. This is what the tech heads call AI alignment or value alignment. In layman’s terms, it’s making sure AI doesn’t go off the rails, that it plays nicely in the sandbox. The larger we make these models, the more room there is for errors, and not just typos, but grand faux pas. Imagine having all the knowledge of the internet – but also all its myths, prejudices, and midnight conspiracy theories. That's how these large models learn. They gobble up vast chunks of the internet and regurgitate it, warts and all. The stakes? Without this alignment, our well-intentioned AI, given a slightly misdirected task, might churn out content that's harmful or even dangerous. It could inadvertently become the ally of someone with less than honorable intentions or sway someone vulnerable down a dark path. So, when we talk about AI alignment, we’re essentially talking about the guiding principles, the conscience, if you will, of AI. And in a world where AI might soon be as ubiquitous as smartphones, that's something we really ought to get right.\n",

      "The ColBERT model is trained using a pairwise ranking loss, where the training data consists of triples ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 + , 𝑑 − ) (q,d + ,d − ), where 𝑞 q represents a query, 𝑑 + d + is a relevant (positive) document for the query, and 𝑑 − d − is a non-relevant (negative) document. The model aims to learn representations such that the similarity score between 𝑞 q and 𝑑 + d + is higher than the score between q and 𝑑 − d − . The training objective can be mathematically represented as minimizing the following loss function: L o s s = max ⁡ ( 0 , 1 − 𝑆 ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 + ) + 𝑆 ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 − ) ) Loss=max(0,1−S(q,d + )+S(q,d − )) , where 𝑆 ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 ) S(q,d) denotes the similarity score computed by ColBERT between a query 𝑞 q and a document 𝑑 d. This score is obtained by aggregating the max-similarity scores of the best-matching embeddings between the query and the document, following the late interaction pattern described in the model architecture. This approach ensures that the model is trained to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant documents for a given query, by encouraging a larger margin in the similarity scores for positive and negative document pairs. Denoised supervision in ColBERTv2 Denoised supervision in ColBERTv2 refines the original training process by selecting challenging negatives and leveraging a cross-encoder for distillation. This sophisticated method of augmenting training data quality involves several steps: Initial Training: Utilizing the official triples from the MS MARCO dataset, comprising a query, a relevant document, and a non-relevant document. Indexing and Retrieval: Employing ColBERTv2's compression to index training passages, followed by retrieving top-k passages for each query. Cross-Encoder Reranking: Enhancing passage selection through reranking by a MiniLM cross-encoder, distilling its scores into ColBERTv2. Forming Training Tuples: Generating w-way tuples for training, incorporating both high and lower-ranked passages to create challenging examples. Iterative Refinement: Repeating the process to continually improve the selection of hard negatives, thereby enhancing model performance. Note, this process represents a sophisticated enhancement to the ColBERT training regime rather than a fundamental change to its architecture.\n",

      "arXiv.org Peitian Zhang Text embeddings have becomevery popular for information retrieval tasks. However, performing an exact embedding vector search requires one to calculate similarities between the embedding representation of the query and the embedding of each document. This becomes very slow for large datasets and leads to latencies that are not acceptable for real-world search applications. Therefore, many applications use approximated nearest neighbor search techniques to speed up the search system, whereby many of these techniques rely on vector quantization algorithms that learn an index of clusters based on the data distribution. In addition, hybrid search has become popular which combines embedding-based search with traditional BM25-based search techniques. Usually, BM25 and embedding search are performed completely independently in hybrid search settings and only the result sets are combined. Hype and Hybrids: Search is more than Keywords and Vectors Twenty years ago, “hybrid” was a term used only by botanists and chemists. Today, hybrid is booming… even in search. Many search systems are rolling out hybrid search schemes with the latest AI. But is “hybrid search” really more than a buzzword? GitHub This paper proposed a method to train a joined index of two parts: a cluster selector and a term selector. The cluster selector performs a vector quantization to assign texts into buckets of nearby clusters and the term selector determines the most representative terms of a document BM25 can be used to assign it into buckets associated with those terms, however, this is not trainable and can therefore not adjust to the training data. Alternatively, one can determine the most representative terms in a document with a BERT model with an MLP hat which is applied on each token to determine a score. In this way the term selector becomes trainable. Then the cluster centroids and the BERT model are trained together by using the KL divergence loss with the embedding model as a teacher to obtain a distribution of similarity values. The results in the paper show that this method can retrieve more relevant documents in the same amount of time as standard ANN techniques like HNSW and IVF-PQ implementations. Is ChatGPT Good at Search? Investigating Large Language Models as Re-Ranking Agents Is ChatGPT Good at Search? Investigating Large Language Models as Re-Ranking Agents Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization across various language-related tasks, including search engines. However, existing work utilizes the generative ability of LLMs for Information Retrieval (IR) rather than direct passage ranking. The discrepancy between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the ranking objective poses another challenge. In this paper, we first investigate generative LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 for relevance ranking in IR. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that properly instructed LLMs can deliver competitive, even superior results to state-of-the-art supervised methods on popular IR benchmarks. Furthermore, to address concerns about data contamination of LLMs, we collect a new test set called NovelEval, based on the latest knowledge and aiming to verify the model’s ability to rank unknown knowledge. Finally, to improve efficiency in real-world applications, we delve into the potential for distilling the ranking capabilities of ChatGPT into small specialized models using a permutation distillation scheme. Our evaluation results turn out that a distilled 440M model outperforms a 3B supervised model on the BEIR benchmark. The code to reproduce our results is available at www.github.com/sunnweiwei/RankGPT. arXiv.org Weiwei Sun This paper investigates techniques to utilize LLMs for re-ranking documents. Re-ranking is usually performed in a search system after a first retrieval step to re-order the retrieved documents, e.g., to select the most relevant ones among them. Commonly used models are finetuned transformer models which are called cross encoders. Those receive as input a pair composed of a query and a document candidate and return a relevance score. Besides, more traditional learning-to-rank models like LambdaMart are also popular, especially in cases where the ranking is not only done based on semantic relevance itself. Cross-Encoders — Sentence-Transformers documentation Observing the strong NLP capabilities of LLMs, the authors of this paper wanted to investigate whether Models like GPT4 can be used to rank documents better. However, the limitation of those closed API-based models is usually that probability outputs are not accessible. Accordingly, the paper investigates techniques that rely only on prompting and the generated output text for re-ranking. The technique they propose inserts the documents together with an ID in the prompt and instructs the LLM to output a sequence of IDs with respect to the relevancy of the documents.\n",

      "We want to assign to each image a unique embedding such that the apples are close together and far from the oranges, and vice-versa. We want something like this: To do that, we construct a neural network (which we’re going to call an embedding model) that takes 607,500 dimension vectors as input and outputs some other vector, typically with fewer dimensions. For example, the widely used ViT-B-32 image embedding model transforms input images into 512-dimension embedding vectors. We then train the embedding model with labeled pictures of apples and oranges, instructing it to adjust the network’s weights slowly to separate the embedding vectors for apples and oranges. After many cycles of training, we expect that when we give the model pictures of apples as input, it will output vectors that are closer to each other than they are to the vectors we get when we give it pictures of oranges as inputs. Those output vectors are embeddings, and they collectively form an embedding space. Individual embeddings’ locations encode useful information about their corresponding data objects: In this case, whether something is a picture of an apple or an orange. Telling apples from oranges is a very simplistic scenario, but you might easily imagine scaling it up to many features. In some use cases, we can even construct embeddings where we don’t explicitly say what features are relevant, and we let the neural network figure it out in the training process. For example, we can construct a face recognition system by taking pictures of people’s faces and training an embedding model to output embeddings that place pictures of the same person close together. We can then construct a database of people's pictures with their embedding vectors as keys. We would expect the stored faces to be distributed through the embedding space: We might expect that this embedding space would encode a lot of features that we had never explicitly trained it to encode. For example, it might segregate men from women: Or we might find people clustered together by features of their hair, like baldness or grey: But we would expect that if we gave it another picture of someone in the database, the embedding for that new picture would be closer to the picture we stored of that person than to anyone else: Of course, it would also find people who just look similar, although we hope that they wouldn’t be as close together as two people who are actually the same: This highlights the logic of embedding spaces:\n",

      "Jina AI • 3 minutes read In our recent paper, Multi-Task Contrastive Learning for 8192-Token Bilingual Text Embeddings, we detailed our development of German-English and Spanish-English bilingual text embedding models. Multi-Task Contrastive Learning for 8192-Token Bilingual Text Embeddings We introduce a novel suite of state-of-the-art bilingual text embedding models that are designed to support English and another target language. These models are capable of processing lengthy text inputs with up to 8192 tokens, making them highly versatile for a range of natural language processing tasks such as text retrieval, clustering, and semantic textual similarity (STS) calculations. By focusing on bilingual models and introducing a unique multi-task learning objective, we have significantly improved the model performance on STS tasks, which outperforms the capabilities of existing multilingual models in both target language understanding and cross-lingual evaluation tasks. Moreover, our bilingual models are more efficient, requiring fewer parameters and less memory due to their smaller vocabulary needs. Furthermore, we have expanded the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) to include benchmarks for German and Spanish embedding models. This integration aims to stimulate further research and advancement in text embedding technologies for these languages. arXiv.org Isabelle Mohr Embedding API Start with 1M free tokens. Top-performing, 8192 context length bilingual embeddings for your search and RAG systems.

      "Maybe there's a better way to generate synthetic data or ways to get better models out of less data. But there is no guarantee that more research will solve the problem. In the end, this challenge might force the AI community to get creative. After all, necessity is the mother of invention, and a data-starved AI landscape could spark some truly innovative solutions. Who knows? The next big breakthrough in AI might come not from more data, but from figuring out how to do more with less. What Happens If Only Megacorps Can Afford to Scrape? For many people today, the internet is Facebook, Instagram, and X, viewed through a black glass rectangle they hold in their hand. It’s homogenized, “safe”, and controlled by gatekeepers who decide (via policies and their algorithms) what (and who) you see and what you don’t. It wasn’t always like this. Just a couple of decades ago we had user-generated blogs, independent websites, and much more. In the eighties, there were dozens of operating systems and hardware standards competing. But by the 2010s, Apple and Microsoft had won the day, beginning the trend of homogenization. We see the same thing with web browsers, smartphones, and social media sites. We start off with a burst of diversity and new ideas before the big players hog the ball and make it difficult for anyone else to ply. That said, while those players did have a monopoly, some smaller fry snuck in anyway. (Take Linux and Firefox, for example). “Underdog makes good” is unlikely to happen with LLMs though. When small players lack the financial clout to get access to varied and up-to-date training data, they can’t create high-quality models. And without that, how can they stay in business? The giants have got the resources to keep their AI models gorging on a steady diet of fresh information, even as the wider web tightens its belt. Meanwhile, smaller players and startups are left scraping the bottom of the data barrel, struggling to nourish their algorithms with stale crumbs. It's a knowledge gap that could snowball. As the data-rich get richer in insights and capabilities, the data-poor risk falling further behind, their AIs growing more outdated and less competitive by the day. This isn't just about who has the shiniest AI toys - it's about who gets to shape the future of technology, commerce, and even how we access information. We're looking at a future where a handful of tech behemoths might hold the keys to the most advanced AI kingdoms, while everyone else is left peering in from the digital dark ages. With all the juicy content floating around to be licensed, it’s unlikely one Megacorp will be the one to license it all, like Netflix in the old days. Remember that? You’d sign up for one service and get every show you ever dreamed of. Today, shows are spread across Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, and whatever they’re calling HBO Max this week. Sometimes a show you love can just evaporate into the ether. This could be the future of LLMs: Google has priority access to Reddit, while OpenAI gets access to the Financial Times. iFixit? That data is just no more, merely stored as some dusty embeddings, and never updated. Instead of one model to rule them all, we could be looking at fragmentation and shifting capabilities as licensing rights get juggled between AI vendors. In Conclusion Scraping is here to stay, whether we like it or not. Already, content providers are erecting barriers to limit access, while opening the doors only to those who can afford to license the content. This severely limits the resources any one LLM can learn from, while at the same time, smaller companies are being priced out of the bidding war for lucrative content, and the rest of the spoils are being divvied up between the tech behemoths’ LLMs. It’s the post-Netflix streaming world all over again, just this time for knowledge. While available human-generated data dwindles, AI-generated “slop” is booming. Training models on this can lead to a slowdown in improvement or even model collapse. The only way to fix it is by thinking outside the box - something startups, with their culture of innovation and disruption are ideally suited for. Yet, the very data that is being licensed only to the big players is the very lifeblood such startups need to survive. By limiting fair access to data, the mega-corporations aren't just stifling competition - they're choking the future of AI itself, strangling the very innovation that could propel us beyond this potential digital dark age. The AI revolution is not the future, AI is now.\n",

      "The paper also shows that LLMs can be used to effectively estimate the confidence of an answer by investigating the consistency of the answer. If a high percentage of the answers is equal, this answer also has a high probability being correct. These most frequent answers and the corresponding reasoning paths can then be used to construct additional prompts for constructing additional training data. However, the authors propose not only to use those reasoning paths and answers but also to add examples in different formats, e.g., presenting the question without any reasoning path and using the question together with some generic instruction like “Let’s think step by step”. Finally, this enhanced training dataset can be used to fine-tune the LLM on the specific task. In their evaluation the authors show this technique is effective to fine-tune LLMs with minimal training data but also that it generalizes well, as it improves the result on out-of-domain datasets. Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Transformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents. We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These language models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments, and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT and Llama-2 models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations and find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference costs. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrievalaugmented language modeling and a passage re-ranking task. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution to extend the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts. arXiv.org Alexis Chevalier Language models are usually constrained by limited context length. While there are various techniques like AliBi to construct language models that can handle larger context lengths, those techniques do not help in cases where you want to use an existing model that has only a very limited context length. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi’s inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark. arXiv.org Ofir Press Instead, this paper addresses this problem by introducing a new method that allows one to fine-tune an exciting language model to apply it to longer context lengths. To achieve this, the model's vocabulary is extended by a fixed number of summary tokens, which are supposed to tell the model to summarize the content of the other tokens in the respective embeddings. During inference, the text input is segmented into shorter text sequences which are extended with the summary tokens and prepended with the output summary vectors of the previously processed segments. To fine-tune the model to handle long sequences, the model is trained on a next-token prediction task. Thereby, the model should make use of the information encoded in the summary embeddings of the previous segments. Notably, the segment length is varied during the training and the backpropagation is done for one document as a whole. In other words, the model is first applied to all sequences in the afore-described scheme before starting the backpropagation. The technique is evaluated by the authors on OPT models of various sizes and the 7-B-Llama-2 model.\n",

      "The paper also shows that LLMs can be used to effectively estimate the confidence of an answer by investigating the consistency of the answer. If a high percentage of the answers is equal, this answer also has a high probability being correct. These most frequent answers and the corresponding reasoning paths can then be used to construct additional prompts for constructing additional training data. However, the authors propose not only to use those reasoning paths and answers but also to add examples in different formats, e.g., presenting the question without any reasoning path and using the question together with some generic instruction like “Let’s think step by step”. Finally, this enhanced training dataset can be used to fine-tune the LLM on the specific task. In their evaluation the authors show this technique is effective to fine-tune LLMs with minimal training data but also that it generalizes well, as it improves the result on out-of-domain datasets. Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Transformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents. We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These language models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments, and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT and Llama-2 models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations and find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference costs. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrievalaugmented language modeling and a passage re-ranking task. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution to extend the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts. arXiv.org Alexis Chevalier Language models are usually constrained by limited context length. While there are various techniques like AliBi to construct language models that can handle larger context lengths, those techniques do not help in cases where you want to use an existing model that has only a very limited context length. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi’s inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark. arXiv.org Ofir Press Instead, this paper addresses this problem by introducing a new method that allows one to fine-tune an exciting language model to apply it to longer context lengths. To achieve this, the model's vocabulary is extended by a fixed number of summary tokens, which are supposed to tell the model to summarize the content of the other tokens in the respective embeddings. During inference, the text input is segmented into shorter text sequences which are extended with the summary tokens and prepended with the output summary vectors of the previously processed segments. To fine-tune the model to handle long sequences, the model is trained on a next-token prediction task. Thereby, the model should make use of the information encoded in the summary embeddings of the previous segments. Notably, the segment length is varied during the training and the backpropagation is done for one document as a whole. In other words, the model is first applied to all sequences in the afore-described scheme before starting the backpropagation. The technique is evaluated by the authors on OPT models of various sizes and the 7-B-Llama-2 model.\n",

      "What is an embedding? An embedding is a representation of some data object as a vector, constructed so that some properties of the data object are encoded into the geometric properties of its vector representation. That’s awfully abstract, but it’s not really as complicated as it sounds. First, we need to introduce a little (very little) bit of math. A vector is two things that sound like they're different but are actually the same: A vector is a point in a multidimensional space. A vector is an ordered list of scalar values, i.e., numbers. To see how this works, consider lists of two numbers. For example, ( 6 , 4 ) (6,4) and ( 2 , 8 ) (2,8). You see that we could treat them as coordinates on an x-y axis, with each list corresponding to a point in a two-dimensional space: If we have three numbers, like ( 3 , 2 , 5 ) (3,2,5) and ( 4 , 5 , 2 ) (4,5,2), then this corresponds to points in a three-dimensional space: The important point is that we could extend this into more dimensions: four, five, a hundred, a thousand, even millions or billions. Drawing a space with a thousand dimensions is very hard, and imagining one is all but impossible, but mathematically, it’s really easy. For example, the distance between points ( 6 , 4 ) (6,4) and ( 2 , 8 ) (2,8) is simply an application of Pythagoras’ theorem. Given two points 𝑎 = ( 𝑥 1 , 𝑦 1 ) a=(x 1 ​ ,y 1 ​ ) and 𝑏 = ( 𝑥 2 , 𝑦 2 ) b=(x 2 ​ ,y 2 ​ ), the distance between them is: For ( 6 , 4 ) (6,4) and ( 2 , 8 ) (2,8), this means: For three dimensions, we just extend the formula by adding a term. For 𝑎 = ( 3 , 2 , 5 ) a=(3,2,5) and 𝑏 = ( 4 , 5 , 2 ) b=(4,5,2): We can extend this formula to vectors in any number of dimensions. We just add more terms, the same way we did by going from two to three dimensions. Besides distance, another measurement we use in high-dimensional vector spaces is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. If you see each vector not just as a point but as a line from the origin (the point designated by the vector ( 0 , 0 , 0 , . . . ) (0,0,0,...)), then you can calculate the angle between the two vectors ( 𝜃 θ in the image below). To calculate this, we have another formula that scales up to any number of dimensions. We know that the cosine of the angle 𝜃 θ between vectors 𝑎 a and 𝑏 b is: This is more complicated than it looks, but not much. 𝑎 ⋅ 𝑏 a⋅b is called the dot product of the two vectors, and it’s easy to calculate. If 𝑎 = ( 3 , 2 , 5 ) a=(3,2,5) and 𝑏 = ( 4 , 5 , 2 ) b=(4,5,2), then: As for ‖ 𝑎 ‖ ‖a‖ and ‖ 𝑏 ‖ ‖b‖, those are the lengths of the vectors, i.e., the distance from the origin to that point. So: Therefore, to calculate 𝑐 𝑜 𝑠 𝜃 cosθ: This cosine corresponds to an angle of approximately 39.3°, but in machine learning, we typically stop once we’ve calculated the cosine because if all the numbers in both vectors are greater than zero, then the cosine of the angle will be between 0 and 1.

They are also relatively easy to fine-tune to improve their performance in specific domains.

For instance, before GPT-4's grand entrance, OpenAI summoned over 50 scholars and experts from diverse fields to put it through its paces. Their mission? To probe the model with a gamut of challenging or potentially harmful queries, testing the waters for issues ranging from misinformation and harmful content to biases and sensitive information leakage.

OpenAI, for instance, trained GPT-4 to self-reflect, penning automated explanations about its predecessor, GPT-2's neural behaviors, and even grading its introspection. Meanwhile, other researchers are tackling alignment by delving into mechanistic interpretability, peeling back the layers to comprehend the AI's inner machinations. Language models can explain neurons in language models We use GPT-4 to automatically write explanations for the behavior of neurons in large language models and to score those explanations. We release a dataset of these (imperfect) explanations and scores for every neuron in GPT-2. As we continue on this odyssey of aligning AI with our human values, it's an intricate dance of intervention, testing, filtering, and most crucially, understanding. It's about ensuring that as AI grows, it not only knows its strength but uses it wisely. Traversing the AI Labyrinth: A Marathon, Not a Sprint In the vast tapestry of AI research, the notion of 'value alignment' seems to gleam with particular significance. As we delve deeper, it's clear we're at a crossroads of ethics, technology, and perhaps a sprinkle of existential contemplation. Think of it as a bustling intersection, full of potential but not without its challenges. The tech frontier is often marked by rapid leaps and bounds. But as we venture into aligning AI with human values, the question arises: do we select from a curated list of values, or should we stand back, squint, and discern a broader, collective societal heartbeat? The brightest minds in AI have made strides, yet landing on a universally accepted set of 'human values' feels akin to trying to bottle a cloud. It’s intangible, elusive, and endlessly fascinating. And let’s not forget the dizzying pace of AI evolution. It's not just progressing; it’s on a veritable sprint. Our ability to oversee and comprehend is being tested. The crux is this: how do we coalesce with entities whose computational depths may soon eclipse our own grasp? OpenAI's recent gambit, the formation of a 'Superalignment' team, is emblematic of this challenge. It’s about making AI introspective, having it tackle its own alignment issues.

      "Is Scraping Even Legal? 💡 We are not lawyers and cannot offer legal advice. The following is an overview of existing law, provided for informational purposes. Is scraping problematic? Yes. It it legal? Also yes. Web scraping is legal in the US, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Canada. No country appears to have laws specifically addressing this practice, but courts around the world generally agree that it’s legal to use automation to visit websites that are open for anyone to see, and to make private copies of their content. People sometimes believe that by placing some printed notice on a web page or in a robots.txt file, they can forbid scraping or other legal uses of their website and its contents. This doesn’t really work. Notices like that have no legal meaning, and robots.txt is an IETF convention that has no force of law. Without some act of confirmation, at a minimum clicking the button marked “I accept the Terms of Service”, you cannot impose conditions on visitors to your website, and even then they are often legally unenforceable. Your Website Terms of Service are Unenforceable | Insights | Venable LLP Venable LLP Joshua J. Kaufman However, while scraping is legal, there are some limitations: Practices that might reduce the usability of a website for others, like hitting it too often or too fast with your web-scraper, may have civil or even criminal consequences in extreme cases. Many countries have laws that criminalize accessing computers in unauthorized ways. If there are parts of a website that are clearly not meant to be accessed by the general public, it may be illegal to scrape them. Many countries have laws that make it illegal to circumvent anti-copying technologies. If a website has put in place measures to prevent you from downloading some content, you may be breaking the law if you scrape it anyway. Websites that have explicit terms of service, and require you to confirm your acceptance of them, can forbid scraping and take you to court if you do it, but the results are spotty. In the US, there is no explicit law regarding scraping, but efforts to use the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to forbid it have failed, most recently in the Ninth Circuit case hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn in 2019. US law is complex, with a lot of court-made distinctions and a system of state and federal circuit jurisdictions that mean that unless the Supreme Court rules on something, it’s not necessarily final. (And sometimes isn’t final even then.) The EU doesn’t have any specific laws addressing scraping either, but it has been a common and unchallenged practice for a very long time. The Text and Data Mining clause in the 2019 EU Copyright Directive strongly implies that scraping is generally legal. The biggest legal problems are not with the act of scraping but with what happens after you scrape. Copyright still applies to the data you scrape from the web. You can keep a personal copy, but you can’t redistribute or resell it, not without some potential for legal problems. Doing large-scale web scraping almost always means making copies of “personal data”, as defined in various data protection and privacy laws. The European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) defines “personal data” as: [A]ny information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person; [GDPR, Art. 4.1] If you possess a store of personal data regarding any person residing in the EU or activity taking place in the EU, you have legal responsibilities under the GDPR. Its scope is so broad that you should assume it’s true for any large data collection. It doesn’t matter if you collected the data or someone else did, if you have it now, you are responsible for it. If you don’t fulfil your GDPR obligations, the EU can punish you regardless of what country you live in or where the data is stored or processed. Canada’s PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) is similar to the GDPR. Japan’s APPI (Act on the Protection of Personal Information) covers much of the same ground. The UK incorporated most elements of the GDPR into their domestic laws on leaving the EU, and unless amended later, they are still in force. The US doesn’t have a comparable data protection law at the federal level, but the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) has similar terms to the GDPR and applies if you have data about people or activities in the state of California.\n",

      "One major barrier to implementing AI coding is one that holds up a lot of AI work: The kinds of very large AI models that produce high-quality results are very expensive to train and run. Members of the GPT family of closed-access models are not only expensive but also remotely hosted with unclear security. Ideally, we would like to have smaller but more specialized models that can give comparable performance to the large models but run on less expensive hardware that users can keep under their own control. This article is a step in that direction, demonstrating that it is feasible, and a way to do it inexpensively. More data vs. better data: Scaling factors in AI All else being equal, we know that the performance of an AI model depends on three scaling factors: Training time. Models trained for more cycles perform better than identical models trained for fewer on the same data. Data size. Models trained with more data perform better than identical models trained with less, given the same training time. Number of parameters, i.e., the size of the model. A model with more weights (or more neurons, which is the same thing) performs better than one with fewer, given the same training data and training time. To build a model with a smaller size but comparable performance to a larger one, we should, logically, use more data and more training cycles. But all else is not always equal. Data quality is a more difficult factor to quantify than training time, data size, or model size, but it makes a significant difference to performance. Intuitively, the model should learn better to solve a particular kind of problem if it learns from the most instructive examples. The problem with improving data quality is that it can be difficult or expensive to curate enough high-quality data to make a difference. Using AI models as both teacher and student One solution is to use AI models to create training data. This has the benefit of being much cheaper than commissioning humans to create enough data or paying them to curate existing data, picking out just the most relevant examples. At first glance, this seems counter-intuitive. If the model is already good enough to create high-quality training data to learn to solve a problem, then surely it can’t use this knowledge to improve its own performance. And this is true. But when the goal is to train a smaller, less capable AI to improve its performance, and we use a much more capable AI to create the training data, it makes just as much sense as a child learning to read from a teacher who is already literate. This is especially relevant to our goal of creating a smaller model with performance comparable to larger ones. We know that a smaller model will need more examples and more training time to reach the same result as a larger one, if it can reach it at all. What a 100 billion parameter model can learn from a thousand examples of sufficient quality might take a million equally high-quality examples for a 1 billion parameter model. The cost of human construction or curation of a million items of training data is a lot more than a thousand, no matter what the problem is.\n",

      "Graph embedding is the art of translating this city (or graph) into a simplified map, where each point of interest (or node) is represented by a coordinate in a lower-dimensional space. Mathematically, it's about learning a function 𝑓 : 𝑣 𝑖 → 𝑦 𝑖 ∈ 𝑅 𝑑 f:v i ​ →y i ​ ∈R d that maps each node 𝑣 𝑖 v i ​ to a vector 𝑦 𝑖 y i ​ in a space 𝑅 𝑑 R d where 𝑑 d is much smaller than ∣ 𝑉 ∣ ∣V∣. Source: TigerGraph - Graph Embedding: Understanding Graph Embedding AlgorithmsS Why is Graph Embedding a Game-Changer? From predicting potential friendships on social media to visualizing intricate datasets, graph embeddings are proving invaluable. They're pivotal in node classification tasks, link predictions, and even in clustering nodes with similar properties. Moreover, as we venture into the realm of multimodal AI, where different types of data converge, graph embeddings can serve as a bridge, connecting structured data with unstructured data. Machine Learning Compatibility: Traditional ML models, from linear regressors to deep neural networks, thrive on numerical data. Graph embeddings translate the intricate relationships of a graph into a numerical format, making them digestible for these models. Preserving Topology and Features: A well-crafted graph embedding retains the original graph's structure and node features. This dual preservation is a challenge that many earlier methods struggled with. Dimensionality Reduction: Instead of grappling with a dimension for every node, we can now work in a much-reduced space, often just 50-1000 dimensions. This simplification is a boon for computational efficiency. Unearthing Latent Patterns: Beyond the explicit, graph embeddings can tease out hidden relationships, offering insights that might not be immediately apparent in the original graph.\n",

      "AWS Marketplace: Jina AI This article will walk you through creating a Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application exclusively using components from Amazon SageMaker. The models we will use are Jina Embeddings v2 - English, Jina Reranker v1, and the Mistral-7B-Instruct large language model. You can also follow along with a Python Notebook, which you can download or run on Google Colab. Retrieval-Augmented Generation Retrieval-augmented generation is an alternative paradigm in generative AI. Instead of using large language models (LLMs) to directly answer user requests with what it’s learned in training, it takes advantage of their fluent language production while relocating logic and information retrieval to an external apparatus better suited to it. Before invoking an LLM, RAG systems actively retrieve relevant information from some external data source and then feed it to the LLM as part of its prompt. The role of the LLM is to synthesize outside information into a coherent response to user requests, minimizing the risk of hallucination and increasing the relevance and usefulness of the result. A RAG system schematically has at least four components: A data source, typically a vector database of some kind, suited to AI-assisted information retrieval. An information retrieval system that treats the user’s request as a query, and retrieves data that is relevant to answering it. A system, often including an AI-based reranker, that selects some of the retrieved data and processes it into a prompt for an LLM. An LLM, for example one of the GPT models or an open-source LLM like Mistral’s, that takes the user request and the data provided to it and generates a response for the user. Embedding models are well-suited for information retrieval and are often used for that purpose.\n",

      "Reranker API Maximize the search relevancy and RAG accuracy at ease What is a Reranker? Understanding the concept of a reranker often leads us to question the necessity of re-ranking mechanisms in search (ranking) systems. Common questions are, \"Why do we need a reranker?\" and \"Isn't ranking documents by cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings enough already?\" To address these questions, let's first revisit the single embedding cosine similarity approach and its limitations. Cosine similarity quantifies the similarity between two documents by measuring the cosine of the angle between their embedding vectors. This metric is valued for its simplicity and has been used in many vector databases as the default way of retrieval. However, this approach, commonly termed as a representation-based approach, tends to oversimplify interaction between query and documents. Specifically, it struggles with capturing the nuanced interaction at the sub-document level and sub-query level, often missing the full depth of user intent and the fine details of document relevance. The comparison of the representation-based cosine similarity (left) and the reranker (right). This is where rerankers come into play. Utilizing deep neural networks, rerankers delve deeper into the interactions between the query and the shortlisted documents. They move beyond basic document-level embeddings to embrace token-level interactions that occur within the query, within the document, and across the query-document boundary. Although this method is more computationally intensive compared to simple cosine similarity, it enables a nuanced comparison that incorporates context, semantic meaning, and the intent behind the query, substantially improving the relevancy of search results. Vector Search via Cosine Similarity Reranker Interaction Level Document-level embeddings Token-level interactions Computational Demand Low High Most computation happens at Offline, i.e. indexing time Online, i.e. query time Result Broad but superficial matching Highly relevant and precise matching Strengths - Fast and efficient - Simple implementation - Deep contextual understanding - Advanced semantic analysis Limitations - Limited by lack of depth and context - May miss nuances of user intent - Computationally intensive - Requires more sophisticated models Best For Provides a quick, efficient first pass Adds depth, enhancing accuracy and relevance of final search results\n",

      "The paper also shows that LLMs can be used to effectively estimate the confidence of an answer by investigating the consistency of the answer. If a high percentage of the answers is equal, this answer also has a high probability being correct. These most frequent answers and the corresponding reasoning paths can then be used to construct additional prompts for constructing additional training data. However, the authors propose not only to use those reasoning paths and answers but also to add examples in different formats, e.g., presenting the question without any reasoning path and using the question together with some generic instruction like “Let’s think step by step”. Finally, this enhanced training dataset can be used to fine-tune the LLM on the specific task. In their evaluation the authors show this technique is effective to fine-tune LLMs with minimal training data but also that it generalizes well, as it improves the result on out-of-domain datasets. Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Transformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents. We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These language models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments, and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT and Llama-2 models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations and find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference costs. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrievalaugmented language modeling and a passage re-ranking task. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution to extend the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts. arXiv.org Alexis Chevalier Language models are usually constrained by limited context length. While there are various techniques like AliBi to construct language models that can handle larger context lengths, those techniques do not help in cases where you want to use an existing model that has only a very limited context length. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi’s inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark. arXiv.org Ofir Press Instead, this paper addresses this problem by introducing a new method that allows one to fine-tune an exciting language model to apply it to longer context lengths. To achieve this, the model's vocabulary is extended by a fixed number of summary tokens, which are supposed to tell the model to summarize the content of the other tokens in the respective embeddings. During inference, the text input is segmented into shorter text sequences which are extended with the summary tokens and prepended with the output summary vectors of the previously processed segments. To fine-tune the model to handle long sequences, the model is trained on a next-token prediction task. Thereby, the model should make use of the information encoded in the summary embeddings of the previous segments. Notably, the segment length is varied during the training and the backpropagation is done for one document as a whole. In other words, the model is first applied to all sequences in the afore-described scheme before starting the backpropagation. The technique is evaluated by the authors on OPT models of various sizes and the 7-B-Llama-2 model.\n",

      "We’ll look at each in turn. Cone Effect A model built with a CLIP or CLIP-style architecture is actually two separate embedding models hooked together. For image-text multimodal models, this means one model for encoding texts, and a completely separate one for encoding images, as in the schema below. These two models are trained so that an image embedding and a text embedding are relatively close together when the text does a good job of describing the image. You can train a model like this by randomizing the weights in both models, then presenting image and text pairs to it together, training it from scratch to minimize the distance between the two outputs. The original OpenAI CLIP model was trained this way. However, this requires a lot of image-text pairs and a lot of computationally expensive training. For the first CLIP model, OpenAI scraped 400 million image-text pairs from captioned materials on the Internet. More recent CLIP-style models use pre-trained components. This means training each component separately as a good single-mode embedding model, one for texts and one for images. These two models are then further trained together using image-text pairs, a process called contrastive tuning. Aligned image-text pairs are used to slowly “nudge” the weights into making matching text and image embeddings closer together, and non-matching ones farther apart. This approach generally requires less image-text pair data, which is difficult and costly to obtain, and large amounts of plain texts and images without captions, which are much easier to obtain. Jina CLIP (jina-clip-v1) was trained using this latter method.\n",

      "Training Jina Embeddings 2 for Top Performance up to 8,192 Tokens Using ALiBi means that even though Jina Embeddings 2 models support larger input sizes, the models don’t have to be trained with larger input data. The training learned for short sequences scales up to larger ones automatically. Our training is similar to the way other embedding models are trained. We start with masked word pre-training using the circa 170 billion word English-only C4 dataset. Then, we do pairwise contrastive training. This means taking pairs of texts that are known to be similar or dissimilar and adjusting the weights of the embedding model so that similar inputs are closer together, and dissimilar ones are farther apart. We used a new corpus of text pairs, curated by Jina AI, based on the one used to train the Jina Embeddings 1 models. Finally, we fine-tuned the model using text triplets and negative mining, with an in-house training dataset specially augmented with sentences of opposite grammatical polarity. Embedding models have typically had trouble with negative polarity sentences: A sentence like “The dog is in the car” will often have an embedding close to “The dog is outside the car,” even though these are naturally opposite in meaning. We added a collection of positive and negative pairs like this to the training data, using the same methods employed for the Jina Embeddings 1 models to specifically improve performance on this kind of language.

Thereby, the model should make use of the information encoded in the summary embeddings of the previous segments. Notably, the segment length is varied during the training and the backpropagation is done for one document as a whole. In other words, the model is first applied to all sequences in the afore-described scheme before starting the backpropagation. The technique is evaluated by the authors on OPT models of various sizes and the 7-B-Llama-2 model. Besides standard language modeling tasks, the authors also show that the models can be effectively used to solve in-context-learning classification tasks with longer prompts or used for re-ranking. Here the re-ranking follows a language modeling approach in which the passages are re-ranked based on the language model’s likelihood to generate the question from the given passage.

Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. 2022. ACL Anthology Poster Highlights from EMNLP 2023 At EMNLP 2023, alongside the compelling paper presentations, the poster sessions were a hub of vibrant discussion and exchange. Here's a rundown of some standout posters I came across, each offering a unique glimpse into the ongoing research and development within the field of NLP. Can Retriever-Augmented Language Models Reason? A poster from McGill University examined whether Retriever-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) can effectively reason by balancing the capabilities of both the retriever and the language model. The research highlighted the potential shortcomings of retrievers in sourcing all necessary statements for reasoning, and how language models might falter in reasoning even when provided with the required statements. It was a deep dive into improving the interactive components of language models. Contrastive Learning-based Sentence Encoders Researchers from Tohoku University presented findings on how Contrastive Learning (CL) can induce sentence encoders to implicitly weight informative words, enhancing the model's understanding and processing of language. This approach could refine the way sentence encoders prioritize and process key elements in text, making them more efficient and effective. Investigating Semantic Subspaces of Transformer Sentence Embeddings A team from the University of Stuttgart showcased their work on probing the semantic subspaces of transformer sentence embeddings. By employing linear structural probing, they aimed to understand how different layers of a transformer contribute to semantic content processing, offering insights into the inner workings of sentence embeddings. Can Pre-trained Vision and Language Model Answer Visual Information-Seeking Questions? An intriguing poster by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Google Research, and Google DeepMind introduced a benchmark for testing the world knowledge in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) through Visual Information-Seeking Questions. The research focused on the capabilities of retrieval-augmented models and GPT-4 in answering questions that require visual understanding, pushing the envelope on multimodal AI. To Split or Not to Split: Composing Compounds in Contextual Vector Spaces From the University of Stuttgart, a study delved into whether splitting compounds in contextual vector spaces is beneficial for the model's performance. The research explored the impact of compounds on semantic representation and processing, contributing to our understanding of compositional semantics in language models. Subspace Chronicles: How Linguistic Information Emerges, Shifts, and Interacts during Language Model Training This poster detailed an exploration into the dynamics of linguistic information as it emerges and evolves during the training of language models. It's a fascinating look at the underpinnings of language model training and the critical learning phases that define their capabilities. Theory of Mind for Multi-Agent Collaboration via Large Language Models Lastly, a poster outlined research on the Theory of Mind in Large Language Models and their application in multi-agent collaboration tasks. It's an exciting foray into the cognitive capabilities of LMs and their potential in collaborative environments. Embeddings Roundtable: A Birds of a Feather at EMNLP 2023 During EMNLP 2023, we hosted a Birds of a Feather (BoF) session on embeddings that turned into a rich tapestry of insights and discussions. With a crowd of over 80 attendees, the session was an electrifying blend of sharp minds and cutting-edge topics.\n",

      "Hybrid Inverted Index Is a Robust Accelerator for Dense Retrieval Hybrid Inverted Index Is a Robust Accelerator for Dense Retrieval Inverted file structure is a common technique for accelerating dense retrieval. It clusters documents based on their embeddings; during searching, it probes nearby clusters w.r.t. an input query and only evaluates documents within them by subsequent codecs, thus avoiding the expensive cost of exhaustive traversal. However, the clustering is always lossy, which results in the miss of relevant documents in the probed clusters and hence degrades retrieval quality. In contrast, lexical matching, such as overlaps of salient terms, tends to be strong feature for identifying relevant documents. In this work, we present the Hybrid Inverted Index (HI 2 2 ), where the embedding clusters and salient terms work collaboratively to accelerate dense retrieval. To make best of both effectiveness and efficiency, we devise a cluster selector and a term selector, to construct compact inverted lists and efficiently searching through them. Moreover, we leverage simple unsupervised algorithms as well as end-to-end knowledge distillation to learn these two modules, with the latter further boosting the effectiveness. Based on comprehensive experiments on popular retrieval benchmarks, we verify that clusters and terms indeed complement each other, enabling HI 2 2 to achieve lossless retrieval quality with competitive efficiency across various index settings. Our code and checkpoint are publicly available at https://github.com/namespace-Pt/Adon/tree/HI2.\n",

      "jinaai/code_exercises · Datasets at Hugging Face We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science. Fine-tuning StarCoder 1B StarCoder 1B is a one-billion-parameter model from a family of pre-trained models designed to perform programming tasks in multiple programming languages. It was pre-trained on The Stack dataset, a collection of code items from GitHub with permissive licenses. We did full parameter fine-tuning using the synthetic dataset described above, with a batch size of 128 and a micro-batch size of 8. Our training hardware was a RunPod cloud instance with an NVIDIA A40 GPU. 💡 The fine-tuning compute cost, using a cloud-based rented GPU, was approximately 10 USD. This compares very favorably to the cost of fine-tuning OpenAI’s closed-access GPT models or the larger open-access models like Llama 2. We have made the entire weight set of our fine-tuned StarCoder 1B available as a HuggingFace model. You are free to download, use, and retrain it. jinaai/starcoder-1b-textbook · Hugging Face We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science. Evaluation To evaluate our training, we used the standard HumanEval benchmark (Chen et al. 2021). This benchmark consists of 164 human-made programming problems written in English and a set of Python unit tests to verify that a proposed solution correctly solves the problem. For example, we gave our fine-tuned model the following prompt from HumanEval: from typing import List, Optional def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]: \"\"\" Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty. >>> longest([]) >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c']) 'a' >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc']) 'ccc' \"\"\" The modified StarCoder 1B produced as output: from typing import List, Optional def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]: \"\"\" Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty. >>> longest([]) >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c']) 'a' >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc']) 'ccc' \"\"\" if not strings: return None longest_string = strings[0] for string in strings[1:]: if len(string) > len(longest_string): longest_string = string return longest_string This function passes all the unit tests for finding the longest string in a list of strings and is therefore marked as successful. Our fine-tuned StarCoder 1B is also able to handle more abstract problems that can involve world knowledge. For example, it generated the code for this function from the text docstring description. The actual number-to-letter maps for Roman numeral conversion were not provided in the prompt: def int_to_mini_roman(number): \"\"\" Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string, and return it in lowercase. Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000 Examples: >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix' >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii' >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi' \"\"\" roman_numerals = { 1000: 'M', 900: 'CM', 500: 'D', 400: 'CD', 100: 'C', 90: 'XC', 50: 'L', 40: 'XL', 10: 'X', 9: 'IX', 5: 'V', 4: 'IV', 1: 'I' } roman_numeral = \"\" for value, symbol in roman_numerals.items(): while number >= value: roman_numeral += symbol number -= value return roman_numeral.lower()\n",

      "Analogous to real-life interactions, difficulties in getting things done often stem not from flawed logic but from problematic communications. This explains why many, particularly non-native speakers, find prompt engineering challenging. I've observed highly competent software engineers in my company struggle with prompt engineering, not due to a lack of logics, but because they do not \"speak the vibe.\" By separating the logic from the prompt, DSPy enables deterministic programming of logic via dspy.Module, allowing developers to shift focus to logic in the same way they would in traditional engineering, irrespective of the LLM used. So, if developers focus on the logic who then manages the textual representation? DSPy takes on this role, utilizing your data and evaluation metrics to refine the textual representation—everything from determining the narrative focus to optimizing hints, and choosing good demonstrations. Remarkably, DSPy can even use evaluation metrics to fine-tune the LLM weights! To me, DSPy's key contributions—closing the loop of training and evaluation in prompt engineering and separating logic from textual representation—underscore its potential significance to LLM/Agent systems. Ambitious vision for sure, but definitely necessary! What I Think DSPy Can Improve First, DSPy presents a steep learning curve for newcomers due to its idioms. Terms like signature, module, program, teleprompter, optimization, and compile can be overwhelming. Even for those proficient in prompt engineering, navigating these concepts within DSPy can be a challenging maze. This complexity echoes my experience with Jina 1.0, where we introduced a slew of idioms such as chunk, document, driver, executor, pea, pod, querylang and flow (we even designed adorable stickers to help user remember!). Most of these early concepts were removed in later Jina refactoring. Today, only Executor, Document, and Flow have survived from \"the great purge.\" We did add a new concept, Deployment, in Jina 3.0; so that evens things out. 🤷 This problem isn't unique to DSPy or Jina; recall the myriad concepts and abstractions introduced by TensorFlow between versions 0.x to 1.x. I believe this problem often emerges in the early stages of software frameworks, where there's a push to reflect academic notations directly in the codebase to ensure maximum accuracy and reproducibility. However, not all users value such granular abstractions, with preferences varying from the desire for simple one-liners to demands for greater flexibility. I discussed this topic of abstraction in software frameworks extensively in a 2020 blog post, which interested readers might find worthwhile.

Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Transformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents. We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These language models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments, and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT and Llama-2 models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations and find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference costs. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrievalaugmented language modeling and a passage re-ranking task. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution to extend the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts. arXiv.org Alexis Chevalier Language models are usually constrained by limited context length. While there are various techniques like AliBi to construct language models that can handle larger context lengths, those techniques do not help in cases where you want to use an existing model that has only a very limited context length. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi’s inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark. arXiv.org Ofir Press Instead, this paper addresses this problem by introducing a new method that allows one to fine-tune an exciting language model to apply it to longer context lengths. To achieve this, the model's vocabulary is extended by a fixed number of summary tokens, which are supposed to tell the model to summarize the content of the other tokens in the respective embeddings. During inference, the text input is segmented into shorter text sequences which are extended with the summary tokens and prepended with the output summary vectors of the previously processed segments. To fine-tune the model to handle long sequences, the model is trained on a next-token prediction task. Thereby, the model should make use of the information encoded in the summary embeddings of the previous segments. Notably, the segment length is varied during the training and the backpropagation is done for one document as a whole.

      "Liang et al. [2022] also discovered that standard contrastive learning practices — the mechanism we use to train CLIP-style multimodal models — tend to reinforce the multimodal gap. Contrastive learning is fundamentally a simple concept. We have an image embedding and a text embedding and we know they should be closer together, so we adjust the weights in the model during training to do that. We go slowly, adjusting the weights by a small amount, and we adjust them in proportion to how far apart the two embeddings are: Closer together means a smaller change than farther apart. This technique works much better if we don’t just bring embeddings closer together when they match, but also move them further apart when they don’t match.\n",

This looks like a lot of math, but if you look it over, you’ll see that it’s just addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, one exponent, and a square root. Simple but boring and repetitive stuff. You don’t actually have to do any of this math. The whole reason we keep computers around is to do that sort of thing. But you should understand that vectors are lists of numbers, understand the concept of working with vectors, and understand how, no matter how many dimensions a vector has, we can still do things like calculate distances and angles. What makes this so important is that any data we keep on a computer is also just a list of numbers. Every data item — digital pictures, texts, audio recordings, 3D model files, anything you can think of that you can put into a computer file — is a vector if we choose to look at it that way. How do we assign embedding vectors to things?\n",

      "search notifications NEWS PRODUCTS COMPANY Opinion August 14, 2024 By Hoovering Up the Web, AI Is Poisoning Itself What does it mean for LLMs when the web has been strip-mined clean, content providers have locked their doors, and there’s barely a trickle of new data to scrape? Alex C-G, Scott Martens • 17 minutes read There's been a lot of pixels spilled recently about the perils of AI companies hoovering up all the data on the internet, whether they have \"permission\" to or not. We'll go into \"permission\" a bit later - there's a reason we wrapped the word in scare quotes. But what does it mean for LLMs when the open web has been strip-mined clean, content providers have locked their doors, and there’s barely a trickle of new data to scrape? The Dangers of AI Scraping AI companies are treating the internet like an all-you-can-eat data buffet, and they're not bothering with table manners. Just look at Runway harvesting YouTube videos for training their model (against YouTube's terms of service), Anthropic hitting iFixit a million times a day and the New York Times suing OpenAI and Microsoft over use of copyrighted works. Trying to block scrapers in your robots.txt or terms of service doesn’t really help in any way. The scrapers who don’t care will scrape anyway, while the more considerate ones will be blocked.\n",

      "DSPy: The framework for programming—not prompting—foundation models DSPy: The framework for programming—not prompting—foundation models - stanfordnlp/dspy GitHub stanfordnlp Despite my background with Jina AI, which primarily focuses on the search foundation, my interest in DSPy was not directly driven by its potential in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Instead, I was intrigued by the possibility of leveraging DSPy for automatic prompt tuning to address some generation tasks. If you're new to DSPy and seeking an accessible entry point, or if you're familiar with the framework but find the official documentation to be confusing or overwhelming, this article is intended for you. I also opt not to adhere strictly to DSPy's idiom, which may seem daunting to newcomers. That said, let's dive deeper. What I Like About DSPy DSPy Closing the Loop of Prompt Engineering What excites me most about DSPy is its approach to closing the loop of the prompt engineering cycle, transforming what is often a manual, handcrafted process into a structured, well-defined machine learning workflow: i.e. preparing datasets, defining the model, training, evaluating, and testing. In my opinion, this is the most revolutionary aspect of DSPy. Traveling in the Bay Area and talking to a lot of startup founders focused on LLM evaluation, I've encountered frequent discussions about metrics, hallucinations, observability, and compliance. However, these conversations often don't progress to the critical next steps: With all these metrics in hand, what do we do next? Can tweaking the phrasing in our prompts, in hopes that certain magic words (e.g., \"my grandma is dying\") might boost our metrics, be considered a strategic approach? This question has remained unanswered by many LLM evaluation startups, and it was one I couldn't tackle either—until I discovered DSPy. DSPy introduces a clear, programmatic method for optimizing prompts based on specific metrics, or even for optimizing the entire LLM pipeline, including both prompts and LLM weights. Harrison, the CEO of LangChain, and Logan, the former OpenAI Head of Developer Relations, have both stated on the Unsupervised Learning Podcast that 2024 is expected to be a pivotal year for LLM evaluation. It is for this reason that I believe DSPy deserves more attention than it is right now, as DSPy provides the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. DSPy Separating Logic From Textual Representation Another aspect of DSPy that impresses me is that, it formulates prompt engineering into a reproducible and LLM-agnostic module. To achieve that, it pulls the logic from the prompt, creating a clear separation of concerns between the logic and the textual representation, as illustrated below. In DSPy, Prompt consists of the intrinsic logic (i.e. dspy.Module,) and its textual representation. Logic is immutable, reproducible, testable and LLM-agnostic. Textual representation is just the consequence of the logic. DSPy's concept of logic as the immutable, testable, and LLM-agnostic \"cause\", with textual representation merely as its \"consequence\", may initially seem perplexing. This is especially true in light of the widespread belief, that \"the future of programming language is natural language.\" Embracing the idea that \"prompt engineering is the future,\" one might experience a moment of confusion upon encountering DSPy's design philosophy. Contrary to the expectation of simplification, DSPy introduces an array of modules and signature syntaxes, seemingly regressing natural language prompting to the complexity of C programming! But why take this approach? My understanding is that at the heart of prompt programming lies the core logic, with communication serving as an amplifier, potentially enhancing or diminishing its effectiveness. The directive \"Do sentiment classification\" represents the core logic, whereas phrase like \"Follow these demonstrations or I will fire you\" is one way to communicate it. Analogous to real-life interactions, difficulties in getting things done often stem not from flawed logic but from problematic communications. This explains why many, particularly non-native speakers, find prompt engineering challenging. I've observed highly competent software engineers in my company struggle with prompt engineering, not due to a lack of logics, but because they do not \"speak the vibe.\" By separating the logic from the prompt, DSPy enables deterministic programming of logic via dspy.Module, allowing developers to shift focus to logic in the same way they would in traditional engineering, irrespective of the LLM used. So, if developers focus on the logic who then manages the textual representation? DSPy takes on this role, utilizing your data and evaluation metrics to refine the textual representation—everything from determining the narrative focus to optimizing hints, and choosing good demonstrations. Remarkably, DSPy can even use evaluation metrics to fine-tune the LLM weights!\n",

      "A text embedding model takes texts as inputs and outputs an embedding — a high-dimensional vector — whose spatial relationship to other embeddings is indicative of their semantic similarity, i.e. similar topics, contents, and related meanings. They are often used in information retrieval because the closer the embeddings, the more likely the user will be happy with the response. They are also relatively easy to fine-tune to improve their performance in specific domains. Text reranker models use similar AI principles to compare collections of texts to a query and sort them by their semantic similarity. Using a task-specific reranker model, instead of relying on just an embedding model, often dramatically increases the precision of search results. The reranker in a RAG application selects some of the results of information retrieval in order to maximize the probability that the right information is in the prompt to the LLM.\n",

      "Breaking the Curse of Recursion by Accumulating Real and Synthetic Data The proliferation of generative models, combined with pretraining on web-scale data, raises a timely question: what happens when these models are trained on their own generated outputs? Recent investigations into model-data feedback loops proposed that such loops would lead to a phenomenon termed model collapse, under which performance progressively degrades with each model-data feedback iteration until fitted models become useless. However, those studies largely assumed that new data replace old data over time, where an arguably more realistic assumption is that data accumulate over time. In this paper, we ask: what effect does accumulating data have on model collapse? We empirically study this question by pretraining sequences of language models on text corpora. We confirm that replacing the original real data by each generation’s synthetic data does indeed tend towards model collapse, then demonstrate that accumulating the successive generations of synthetic data alongside the original real data avoids model collapse; these results hold across a range of model sizes, architectures, and hyperparameters. We obtain similar results for deep generative models on other types of real data: diffusion models for molecule conformation generation and variational autoencoders for image generation. To understand why accumulating data can avoid model collapse, we use an analytically tractable framework introduced by prior work in which a sequence of linear models are fit to the previous models’ outputs. Previous work used this framework to show that if data are replaced, the test error increases with the number of model-fitting iterations; we extend this argument to prove that if data instead accumulate, the test error has a finite upper bound independent of the number of iterations, meaning model collapse no longer occurs. arXiv.org Matthias Gerstgrasser The irony is thick here. AI's voracious appetite for data might lead to a data famine. Model Autophagy Disorder is like Mad Cow Disease for AI: Just like feeding beef waste to cows led to a new kind of parasitic brain disease, training AI from growing amounts of AI output leads to devastating mental pathologies. Self-Consuming Generative Models Go MAD Seismic advances in generative AI algorithms for imagery, text, and other data types has led to the temptation to use synthetic data to train next-generation models. Repeating this process creates an autophagous (self-consuming) loop whose properties are poorly understood. We conduct a thorough analytical and empirical analysis using state-of-the-art generative image models of three families of autophagous loops that differ in how fixed or fresh real training data is available through the generations of training and in whether the samples from previous generation models have been biased to trade off data quality versus diversity. Our primary conclusion across all scenarios is that without enough fresh real data in each generation of an autophagous loop, future generative models are doomed to have their quality (precision) or diversity (recall) progressively decrease. We term this condition Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), making analogy to mad cow disease. arXiv.org Sina Alemohammad The good news is that AI can’t afford to replace humanity because it needs our data. The bad news is that it may stunt its own growth by ruining its data sources. To avoid this foreseeable AI knowledge famine, we need to rethink how we train and use AI models. We’re already seeing solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which tries to avoid using AI models as a source of factual information and sees them instead as devices for evaluating and reorganizing external information sources. Another path forward is via specialization, where we adapt models to perform specific classes of tasks, using curated training data focused on narrow domains. We could replace purported general-purpose models like ChatGPT with specialist AIs: LawLLM, MedLLM, MyLittlePonyLLM, and so on. There are other possibilities, and it’s hard to say what new techniques researchers will discover. Maybe there's a better way to generate synthetic data or ways to get better models out of less data. But there is no guarantee that more research will solve the problem. In the end, this challenge might force the AI community to get creative. After all, necessity is the mother of invention, and a data-starved AI landscape could spark some truly innovative solutions. Who knows? The next big breakthrough in AI might come not from more data, but from figuring out how to do more with less. What Happens If Only Megacorps Can Afford to Scrape? For many people today, the internet is Facebook, Instagram, and X, viewed through a black glass rectangle they hold in their hand. It’s homogenized, “safe”, and controlled by gatekeepers who decide (via policies and their algorithms) what (and who) you see and what you don’t. It wasn’t always like this.\n",

The training learned for short sequences scales up to larger ones automatically. Our training is similar to the way other embedding models are trained. We start with masked word pre-training using the circa 170 billion word English-only C4 dataset. Then, we do pairwise contrastive training. This means taking pairs of texts that are known to be similar or dissimilar and adjusting the weights of the embedding model so that similar inputs are closer together, and dissimilar ones are farther apart. We used a new corpus of text pairs, curated by Jina AI, based on the one used to train the Jina Embeddings 1 models. Finally, we fine-tuned the model using text triplets and negative mining, with an in-house training dataset specially augmented with sentences of opposite grammatical polarity. Embedding models have typically had trouble with negative polarity sentences: A sentence like “The dog is in the car” will often have an embedding close to “The dog is outside the car,” even though these are naturally opposite in meaning. We added a collection of positive and negative pairs like this to the training data, using the same methods employed for the Jina Embeddings 1 models to specifically improve performance on this kind of language.

      "The answer should only use the presented context. If the question cannot be answered based on the context, say so. Context: 1. Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: Since the first offshore wind farm commissioned in 1991 in Denmark, scientists and engineers have adapted and improved the technology of wind energy to offshore conditions. This is a rapidly evolving field with installation of increasingly larger wind turbines in deeper waters. At sea, the challenges are indeed numerous, with combined wind and wave loads, reduced accessibility and uncertain-solid conditions. My name is Axel Vire, I'm an assistant professor in Wind Energy at U-Delf and specializing in offshore wind energy. This course will touch upon the critical aspect of wind energy, how to integrate the various engineering disciplines involved in offshore wind energy. Each week we will focus on a particular discipline and use it to design and operate a wind farm. 2. Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: For example, we look at how to characterize the wind and wave conditions at a given location. How to best place the wind turbines in a farm and also how to retrieve the electricity back to shore. We look at the main design drivers for offshore wind turbines and their components. We'll see how these aspects influence one another and the best choices to reduce the cost of energy. This course is organized by the two-delfd wind energy institute, an interfaculty research organization focusing specifically on wind energy. You will therefore benefit from the expertise of the lecturers in three different faculties of the university. Aerospace engineering, civil engineering and electrical engineering. Hi, my name is Ricardo Pareda. 3. Video-title: Systems Analysis for Problem Structuring part 1B the mono actor perspective example, transcript-segment: So let's assume the demarcation of the problem and the analysis of objectives has led to the identification of three criteria. The security of supply, the percentage of offshore power generation and the costs of energy provision. We now reason backwards to explore what factors have an influence on these system outcomes. Really, the offshore percentage is positively influenced by the installed Wind Power capacity at sea, a key system factor. Capacity at sea in turn is determined by both the size and the number of wind farms at sea. The Ministry of Economic Affairs cannot itself invest in new wind farms but hopes to simulate investors and energy companies by providing subsidies and by expediting the granting process of licenses as needed. Question: When was the first offshore wind farm commissioned? Answer: [/INST] Pass this prompt to the LLM endpoint — model_predictor — via the method model_predictor.predict(): answer = model_predictor.predict({\"inputs\": prompt_for_llm}) This returns a list, but since we only passed in one prompt, it will be a list with one entry. Each entry is a dict with the response text under the key generated_text: answer = answer[0]['generated_text'] print(answer) Result: The first offshore wind farm was commissioned in 1991. (Context: Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: Since the first offshore wind farm commissioned in 1991 in Denmark, ...) Let’s simplify querying by writing a function to do all the steps: taking the string question as a parameter and returning the answer as a string: def ask_rag(question): search_results = find_most_similar_transcript_segment(question) reranked_results = rerank_results(search_results, question) prompt_for_llm = prompt_template.substitute( question = question, title_1 = search_results[0][0], segment_1 = search_results[0][1], title_2 = search_results[1][0], segment_2 = search_results[1][1], title_3 = search_results[2][0], segment_3 = search_results[2][1], ) answer = model_predictor.predict({\"inputs\": prompt_for_llm}) return answer[0][\"generated_text\"] Now we can ask it a few more questions. Answers will depend on the content of the video transcripts. For example, we can ask detailed questions when the answer is present in the data and get an answer: ask_rag(\"What is a Kaplan Meyer estimator?\") The Kaplan Meyer estimator is a non-parametric estimator for the survival function, defined for both censored and not censored data. It is represented as a series of declining horizontal steps that approaches the truths of the survival function if the sample size is sufficiently large enough. The value of the empirical survival function obtained is assumed to be constant between two successive distinct observations. ask_rag(\"Who is Reneville Solingen?\") Reneville Solingen is a professor at Delft University of Technology in Global Software Engineering.\n",

Kipf A Toy Implementation of Graph Embeddings Implementing graph embedding techniques from scratch can be challenging. The algorithm below shows a simple way to generate graph embeddings. It takes an adjacency matrix as input, which represents the connections in a graph. Each row and column corresponds to a node, and a 1 indicates an edge between those nodes. from typing import List import numpy as np def graph_embedding(adj_matrix: List[List[int]], emb_size: int = 16) -> List[np.ndarray]: \"\"\"Generate graph embedding Args: adj_matrix: Adjacency matrix as nested list emb_size: Size of embedding vectors Returns: List of numpy arrays as node embeddings \"\"\" # Initialize empty embeddings embeddings = [np.random.rand(emb_size) for _ in adj_matrix] # Train embedding -visualize nodes moving closer if connected for _ in range(100): for v1, row in enumerate(adj_matrix): for v2, is_connected in enumerate(row): if is_connected: # Move embeddings closer if nodes connected embeddings[v1] -= 0.1 * (embeddings[v1] - embeddings[v2]) return embeddings It initializes an embedding vector of random values for each node. Then it trains these embeddings by iterating through the adjacency matrix to identify connected nodes. For any pair of nodes that are connected, it moves their embedding vectors slightly closer together. This is done by subtracting a fraction of their vector difference from the first node's embedding. Over multiple iterations, nodes that are tightly interconnected will have very similar embedding vectors, while disconnected nodes will remain far apart in the embedding space. The for _ in range(100) loop controls the number of training iterations. More iterations allow the embeddings to converge closer to their optimal values for representing the graph structure. Finally, the embeddings are returned as a list of numpy arrays. Each array is the vector representation for a node.\n",

Launched on a morn in November, with power so fierce and grand, She climbed into the heavens, but 'twas not as Musk had planned. (Chorus) Heave ho, lift high, to the stars we aim to fly, But the rocket's dreams did shatter, and into the sea did die. Heave ho, lift high, with a fiery tail in sky, SpaceX's Starship faltered, and we're left to wonder why. (Verse 2) The booster and the spacecraft, they parted with a roar, The engines blazed like comets, as they'd never done before. The booster met its ending, in a ball of flame it fell, While Starship soared a moment more, then silence cast its spell. Calling other prompt services The above example wasn't exactly modular. I had both the summarizer and shantyizer in one prompt. That isn't so useful if I want to shanty all my things in full detail. Luckily, you can also call one prompt from another, allowing for a lot more modularity: So, if I create a summarizer prompt (named summarizer, which has the sole function of summarizing a web page)… …I can easily call it from a new shantyizer prompt: Sending a URL to the shantyizer prompt in turn processes the URL through the summarizer to download and summarize its contents. And of course, the summarizer can be used in any other prompt you like, acting more like a traditional programming language function. That opens up many more possibilities. Especially when it comes to more complex tasks like cooking a dish. If I’m cooking, for any given recipe I may want one or more of the following steps, but perhaps not all steps for all recipes. Download the content of a recipe page If it's not in English, translate it (if I'm cooking an authentic Chinese recipe, I want it from a real Chinese website) Make it vegetarian (if I'm eating with vegetarian friends) Convert it to metric (because reasons) Change serving size (depending on how many people I'm eating with) Exercise for the reader As you can imagine, if I'm eating alone (and I'm not a vegetarian), my needs are quite different from when I'm eating with my buddies at the local sea kitten appreciation society. Either way, it means combining several of these \"functions\". We can also go multi-modal, combining text and image prompts: Create an image generation prompt from the given recipe Generate an image of how the food should look The exercise for you, dear reader, is to build a prompt that performs the above recipe steps (or similar).

      "The paper also shows that LLMs can be used to effectively estimate the confidence of an answer by investigating the consistency of the answer. If a high percentage of the answers is equal, this answer also has a high probability being correct. These most frequent answers and the corresponding reasoning paths can then be used to construct additional prompts for constructing additional training data. However, the authors propose not only to use those reasoning paths and answers but also to add examples in different formats, e.g., presenting the question without any reasoning path and using the question together with some generic instruction like “Let’s think step by step”. Finally, this enhanced training dataset can be used to fine-tune the LLM on the specific task. In their evaluation the authors show this technique is effective to fine-tune LLMs with minimal training data but also that it generalizes well, as it improves the result on out-of-domain datasets. Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts Transformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents. We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These language models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments, and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT and Llama-2 models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations and find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference costs. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrievalaugmented language modeling and a passage re-ranking task. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution to extend the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts. arXiv.org Alexis Chevalier Language models are usually constrained by limited context length. While there are various techniques like AliBi to construct language models that can handle larger context lengths, those techniques do not help in cases where you want to use an existing model that has only a very limited context length. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi’s inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark. arXiv.org Ofir Press Instead, this paper addresses this problem by introducing a new method that allows one to fine-tune an exciting language model to apply it to longer context lengths. To achieve this, the model's vocabulary is extended by a fixed number of summary tokens, which are supposed to tell the model to summarize the content of the other tokens in the respective embeddings. During inference, the text input is segmented into shorter text sequences which are extended with the summary tokens and prepended with the output summary vectors of the previously processed segments. To fine-tune the model to handle long sequences, the model is trained on a next-token prediction task. Thereby, the model should make use of the information encoded in the summary embeddings of the previous segments. Notably, the segment length is varied during the training and the backpropagation is done for one document as a whole. In other words, the model is first applied to all sequences in the afore-described scheme before starting the backpropagation. The technique is evaluated by the authors on OPT models of various sizes and the 7-B-Llama-2 model.\n",

      "Our evaluations demonstrated remarkable improvements for search systems employing the Jina Reranker with +8% in hit rate and +33% in mean reciprocal rank! Reranker API Maximize the search relevancy and RAG accuracy at ease What is a Reranker? Understanding the concept of a reranker often leads us to question the necessity of re-ranking mechanisms in search (ranking) systems. Common questions are, \"Why do we need a reranker?\" and \"Isn't ranking documents by cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings enough already?\" To address these questions, let's first revisit the single embedding cosine similarity approach and its limitations. Cosine similarity quantifies the similarity between two documents by measuring the cosine of the angle between their embedding vectors. This metric is valued for its simplicity and has been used in many vector databases as the default way of retrieval. However, this approach, commonly termed as a representation-based approach, tends to oversimplify interaction between query and documents. Specifically, it struggles with capturing the nuanced interaction at the sub-document level and sub-query level, often missing the full depth of user intent and the fine details of document relevance. The comparison of the representation-based cosine similarity (left) and the reranker (right). This is where rerankers come into play. Utilizing deep neural networks, rerankers delve deeper into the interactions between the query and the shortlisted documents. They move beyond basic document-level embeddings to embrace token-level interactions that occur within the query, within the document, and across the query-document boundary. Although this method is more computationally intensive compared to simple cosine similarity, it enables a nuanced comparison that incorporates context, semantic meaning, and the intent behind the query, substantially improving the relevancy of search results. Vector Search via Cosine Similarity Reranker Interaction Level Document-level embeddings Token-level interactions Computational Demand Low High Most computation happens at Offline, i.e. indexing time Online, i.e. query time Result Broad but superficial matching Highly relevant and precise matching Strengths - Fast and efficient - Simple implementation - Deep contextual understanding - Advanced semantic analysis Limitations - Limited by lack of depth and context - May miss nuances of user intent - Computationally intensive - Requires more sophisticated models Best For Provides a quick, efficient first pass Adds depth, enhancing accuracy and relevance of final search results\n",

      "A text embedding model takes texts as inputs and outputs an embedding — a high-dimensional vector — whose spatial relationship to other embeddings is indicative of their semantic similarity, i.e. similar topics, contents, and related meanings. They are often used in information retrieval because the closer the embeddings, the more likely the user will be happy with the response. They are also relatively easy to fine-tune to improve their performance in specific domains. Text reranker models use similar AI principles to compare collections of texts to a query and sort them by their semantic similarity. Using a task-specific reranker model, instead of relying on just an embedding model, often dramatically increases the precision of search results. The reranker in a RAG application selects some of the results of information retrieval in order to maximize the probability that the right information is in the prompt to the LLM.\n",

      "The ColBERT model is trained using a pairwise ranking loss, where the training data consists of triples ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 + , 𝑑 − ) (q,d + ,d − ), where 𝑞 q represents a query, 𝑑 + d + is a relevant (positive) document for the query, and 𝑑 − d − is a non-relevant (negative) document. The model aims to learn representations such that the similarity score between 𝑞 q and 𝑑 + d + is higher than the score between q and 𝑑 − d − . The training objective can be mathematically represented as minimizing the following loss function: L o s s = max ⁡ ( 0 , 1 − 𝑆 ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 + ) + 𝑆 ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 − ) ) Loss=max(0,1−S(q,d + )+S(q,d − )) , where 𝑆 ( 𝑞 , 𝑑 ) S(q,d) denotes the similarity score computed by ColBERT between a query 𝑞 q and a document 𝑑 d. This score is obtained by aggregating the max-similarity scores of the best-matching embeddings between the query and the document, following the late interaction pattern described in the model architecture. This approach ensures that the model is trained to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant documents for a given query, by encouraging a larger margin in the similarity scores for positive and negative document pairs. Denoised supervision in ColBERTv2 Denoised supervision in ColBERTv2 refines the original training process by selecting challenging negatives and leveraging a cross-encoder for distillation. This sophisticated method of augmenting training data quality involves several steps: Initial Training: Utilizing the official triples from the MS MARCO dataset, comprising a query, a relevant document, and a non-relevant document. Indexing and Retrieval: Employing ColBERTv2's compression to index training passages, followed by retrieving top-k passages for each query. Cross-Encoder Reranking: Enhancing passage selection through reranking by a MiniLM cross-encoder, distilling its scores into ColBERTv2. Forming Training Tuples: Generating w-way tuples for training, incorporating both high and lower-ranked passages to create challenging examples. Iterative Refinement: Repeating the process to continually improve the selection of hard negatives, thereby enhancing model performance. Note, this process represents a sophisticated enhancement to the ColBERT training regime rather than a fundamental change to its architecture.\n",

Sometimes a show you love can just evaporate into the ether. This could be the future of LLMs: Google has priority access to Reddit, while OpenAI gets access to the Financial Times. iFixit? That data is just no more, merely stored as some dusty embeddings, and never updated. Instead of one model to rule them all, we could be looking at fragmentation and shifting capabilities as licensing rights get juggled between AI vendors. In Conclusion Scraping is here to stay, whether we like it or not. Already, content providers are erecting barriers to limit access, while opening the doors only to those who can afford to license the content. This severely limits the resources any one LLM can learn from, while at the same time, smaller companies are being priced out of the bidding war for lucrative content, and the rest of the spoils are being divvied up between the tech behemoths’ LLMs. It’s the post-Netflix streaming world all over again, just this time for knowledge. While available human-generated data dwindles, AI-generated “slop” is booming. Training models on this can lead to a slowdown in improvement or even model collapse. The only way to fix it is by thinking outside the box - something startups, with their culture of innovation and disruption are ideally suited for. Yet, the very data that is being licensed only to the big players is the very lifeblood such startups need to survive. By limiting fair access to data, the mega-corporations aren't just stifling competition - they're choking the future of AI itself, strangling the very innovation that could propel us beyond this potential digital dark age.\n",

      "Given that ColBERTv2's architecture remains very similar to that of the original ColBERT, with its key innovations revolving around training techniques and compression mechanisms, we will first delve into the foundational aspects of the original ColBERT. What is late interaction in ColBERT? \"Interaction\" refers to the process of evaluating the relevance between a query and a document by comparing their representations. \"Late interaction\" is the essence of ColBERT. The term is derived from the model's architecture and processing strategy, where the interaction between the query and document representations occurs late in the process, after both have been independently encoded. This contrasts with \"early interaction\" models, where query and document embeddings interact at earlier stages, typically before or during their encoding by the model. Interaction Type Models Early Interaction BERT, ANCE, DPR, Sentence-BERT, DRMM, KNRM, Conv-KNRM, etc. Late Interaction ColBERT, ColBERTv2 Early interaction can increase computational complexity since it requires considering all possible query-document pairs, making it less efficient for large-scale applications. Late interaction models like ColBERT optimize for efficiency and scalability by allowing for the pre-computation of document representations and employing a more lightweight interaction step at the end, which focuses on the already encoded representations. This design choice enables faster retrieval times and reduced computational demands, making it more suitable for processing large document collections. Schematic diagrams illustrating query–document interaction paradigms in neural IR, with ColBERT's late interaction on the left-most. No interaction: cosine similarity of document and query embeddings Many practical vector databases and neural search solutions depend on fast cosine similarity matching between document and query embeddings. While appealing for its straightforwardness and computational efficiency, this method, often referred to as \"no interaction\" or \"not interaction-based\" has been found to underperform in comparison to models that incorporate some form of interaction between queries and documents. The core limitation of the \"no interaction\" approach lies in its inability to capture the complex nuances and relationships between query and document terms. Information retrieval, at its heart, is about understanding and matching the intent behind a query with the content within a document. This process often requires a deep, contextual understanding of the terms involved, something that single, aggregated embeddings for documents and queries struggle to provide. Query and document encoders in ColBERT ColBERT's encoding strategy is grounded in the BERT model, known for its deep contextual understanding of language. The model generates dense vector representations for each token in a query or document, creating a bag of contextualized embeddings for a query and a bag for a document, respectively. This facilitates a nuanced comparison of their embeddings during the late interaction phase. Query encoder of ColBERT For a query 𝑄 Q with tokens 𝑞 1 , 𝑞 2 , . . . , 𝑞 𝑙 q 1 ​ ,q 2 ​ ,...,q l ​ , the process begins by tokenizing 𝑄 Q into BERT-based WordPiece tokens and prepending a special [Q] token. This [Q] token, positioned right after BERT’s [CLS] token, signals the start of a query. If the query is shorter than a predefined number of tokens 𝑁 𝑞 N q ​ , it is padded with [mask] tokens up to 𝑁 𝑞 N q ​ ; otherwise, it's truncated to the first 𝑁 𝑞 N q ​ tokens. The padded sequence is then passed through BERT, followed by a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and normalization. The output is a set of embedding vectors termed as 𝐸 𝑞 E q ​ below: 𝐸 𝑞 : = N o r m a l i z e ( B E R T ( [ 𝑄 ] , 𝑞 0 , 𝑞 1 , … , 𝑞 𝑙 [ 𝑚 𝑎 𝑠 𝑘 ] , [ 𝑚 𝑎 𝑠 𝑘 ] , … , [ 𝑚 𝑎 𝑠 𝑘 ] ) ) E q ​ :=Normalize(BERT([Q],q 0 ​ ,q 1 ​ ,…,q l ​ [mask],[mask],…,[mask])) Document encoder of ColBERT Similarly, for a document 𝐷 D with tokens 𝑑 1 , 𝑑 2 , . . . , 𝑑 𝑛 d 1 ​ ,d 2 ​ ,...,d n ​ , a [D] token is prepended to indicate the start of a document.\n",

      "ColBERT's late interaction mechanism is unique in information retrieval because it computes the similarity between the query and the document embeddings at the very end, after both have been processed independently. This allows for a more flexible and nuanced comparison, as it takes into account the specific words and their context in both the query and the document. This approach differs from traditional methods that often rely on term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting or bag-of-words models, which can be less precise and may not capture the subtleties of language as effectively. \n",

      "Training Jina Embeddings 2 for Top Performance up to 8,192 Tokens Using ALiBi means that even though Jina Embeddings 2 models support larger input sizes, the models don’t have to be trained with larger input data. The training learned for short sequences scales up to larger ones automatically. Our training is similar to the way other embedding models are trained. We start with masked word pre-training using the circa 170 billion word English-only C4 dataset. Then, we do pairwise contrastive training. This means taking pairs of texts that are known to be similar or dissimilar and adjusting the weights of the embedding model so that similar inputs are closer together, and dissimilar ones are farther apart. We used a new corpus of text pairs, curated by Jina AI, based on the one used to train the Jina Embeddings 1 models. Finally, we fine-tuned the model using text triplets and negative mining, with an in-house training dataset specially augmented with sentences of opposite grammatical polarity. Embedding models have typically had trouble with negative polarity sentences: A sentence like “The dog is in the car” will often have an embedding close to “The dog is outside the car,” even though these are naturally opposite in meaning. We added a collection of positive and negative pairs like this to the training data, using the same methods employed for the Jina Embeddings 1 models to specifically improve performance on this kind of language.

      "Contrastive Learning and the False Negative Problem Liang et al. [2022] also discovered that standard contrastive learning practices — the mechanism we use to train CLIP-style multimodal models — tend to reinforce the multimodal gap. Contrastive learning is fundamentally a simple concept. We have an image embedding and a text embedding and we know they should be closer together, so we adjust the weights in the model during training to do that. We go slowly, adjusting the weights by a small amount, and we adjust them in proportion to how far apart the two embeddings are: Closer together means a smaller change than farther apart. This technique works much better if we don’t just bring embeddings closer together when they match, but also move them further apart when they don’t match. We want to have not just image-text pairs that belong together, we want pairs that we know belong apart. This poses some problems: Our data sources consist entirely of matching pairs. No one would make a database of texts and images that a human has verified are unrelated, nor could you readily construct one by scraping the web or some other unsupervised or semi-supervised technique. Even image-text pairs that superficially seem completely disjoint aren’t necessarily so. We don’t have a theory of semantics that allows us to objectively make such negative judgments. For example, a picture of a cat lying on a porch is not a completely negative match for the text “a man sleeping on a sofa.” Both involve lying on something. We would ideally want to train with image-text pairs that we knew with certainty were related and unrelated, but there is no obvious way to get known unrelated pairs. It’s possible to ask people “Does this sentence describe this picture?” and expect consistent answers. It’s much harder to get consistent answers from asking “Does this sentence have nothing to do with this picture?” Instead, we get unrelated image-text pairs by randomly selecting pictures and texts from our training data, expecting they will practically always be bad matches. How this works in practice is that we divide our training data into batches. To train Jina CLIP, we used batches containing 32,000 matching image-text pairs, but for this experiment, batch sizes were only 16.\n",

We first define the custom cleaner to remove retrieve tickets that contain either the same issue ID or parent ID as the issue passed as query: from typing import Optional @component class RemoveRelated: @component.output_types(documents=List[Document]) def run(self, tickets: List[Document], query_id: Optional[str]): retrieved_tickets = [] for t in tickets: if not t.meta['Issue id'] == query_id and not t.meta['Parent id'] == query_id: retrieved_tickets.append(t) return {'documents': retrieved_tickets} We then embed the query, retrieve relevant documents, clean the selection, and finally rerank it: from haystack_integrations.components.embedders.jina import JinaTextEmbedder from haystack_integrations.components.rankers.jina import JinaRanker query_pipeline_reranker = Pipeline() query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_embedder_reranker', JinaTextEmbedder(model='jina-embeddings-v2-base-en')) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_retriever_reranker', retriever_reranker) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_cleaner_reranker', RemoveRelated()) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_ranker_reranker', JinaRanker()) query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_embedder_reranker.embedding', 'query_retriever_reranker.query_embedding') query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_retriever_reranker', 'query_cleaner_reranker') query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_cleaner_reranker', 'query_ranker_reranker')\n",

      "Graph embeddings are now more accessible than ever for researchers and developers. Graph Embeddings vs. Sentence Embeddings Graph embeddings and sentence embeddings, both aim to distill intricate structures into compact vector forms, yet they cater to distinct data types and possess their own set of challenges and strengths. Let's embark on an expedition to discern their similarities, differences, and unique attributes. The Common Ground Dimensionality Reduction: Both graph and sentence embeddings endeavor to encapsulate high-dimensional data within a more compact, lower-dimensional space. This transformation not only makes the data more tractable but also primes it for machine learning models. Preservation of Relationships: Be it the intricate ties between nodes in a graph or the semantic dance of words in a sentence, both embeddings are committed to ensuring that the spatial relationships in the original structure find their echo in the embedding space. Facilitating Machine Learning: By transmuting graphs and sentences into fixed-length vectors, both embeddings pave the way for the application of a plethora of machine learning algorithms, spanning from clustering to classification. Diving into the Differences Aspect Graph Embedding Sentence Embedding Nature of Data Focuses on relational data, with nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) taking center stage. Hones in on sequential data, where the order and semantic interplay of words are paramount.\n",

      "Jina AI • 8 minutes read In the grand canvas of technology, AI, with its large models, looms large. We're not just talking about computers that can play chess or identify photos; we're looking at machines that skirt the edge of what we might call 'thinking'. They can chat, they can craft text, they might even surprise you with a poem if you ask nicely. We're living in a world where our AI tools aren't just tools anymore. They're almost colleagues. There's a ballpark figure floating around, suggesting that these generative AI models could inject a few trillion dollars into the world economy annually. That's not pocket change. But here's the hitch. If a computer is becoming more like a human, then it's inheriting all our quirks. Our brilliance, our creativity, yes, but also our biases and blind spots. This isn’t just about AI becoming smart; it’s about AI becoming wise. This is what the tech heads call AI alignment or value alignment. In layman’s terms, it’s making sure AI doesn’t go off the rails, that it plays nicely in the sandbox. The larger we make these models, the more room there is for errors, and not just typos, but grand faux pas. Imagine having all the knowledge of the internet – but also all its myths, prejudices, and midnight conspiracy theories. That's how these large models learn. They gobble up vast chunks of the internet and regurgitate it, warts and all. The stakes? Without this alignment, our well-intentioned AI, given a slightly misdirected task, might churn out content that's harmful or even dangerous. It could inadvertently become the ally of someone with less than honorable intentions or sway someone vulnerable down a dark path. So, when we talk about AI alignment, we’re essentially talking about the guiding principles, the conscience, if you will, of AI. And in a world where AI might soon be as ubiquitous as smartphones, that's something we really ought to get right.\n",

The key difference is that in the first stage, the model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence, while in the second stage, the model is fine-tuned to classify tokens as either `1` or `0`, depending on whether they exist in both the input and output. This two-stage process allows the model to learn general language patterns in the first stage, and then specialize to the HTML-to-Markdown task in the second stage.',\n",

How do you select useful computer programs (software) and equipment (hardware)? If you have a computer or plan to get one, what information can you obtain with your computer that will be useful for your farm operation? This publication will help you answer such questions. It will help you evaluate and select a new system, or get more out of the one you already have. The key components of computer systems you may want to know about are: Hardware--the physical equipment itself. Software--the computer programs on tape or disk, and Online sources of information--such as current market and weather information and technical reports. This publication offers guidelines to help farmers select hardware, software, and online information. (See the glossary at the end of this publication for definitions of specialized computer terms.)\n",
      "=What a Computer Can Do for You= You can use a microcomputer to help you-- Determine the most economical feed ration for dairy cows and other farm animals. Schedule irrigation, Get quick access to records, Keep machinery inventories and depreciation schedules, Help with tax records and making out income tax returns, Keep livestock breeding and production records, Keep a record of loans and cash flow to meet interest and principal payments, Determine levels of earnings by working through a profit and loss statement and by calculating a percentage return to capital and a percentage return to equity, Decide the optimum production choice for a particular farm in a given year, and the optimum combination of inputs to grow the crops or livestock chosen, Store large amounts of data, and Get current market and weather information if the microprocessor is connected via the telephone to data bases (see section on online services). Software programs are also available in such areas as financial management, crop and field records, mailing lists for customers of certified seed and breeding stock, machinery purchase versus custom hiring, investment feasibility of building and livestock facilities, commodity price charts and tables, income taxation, marketing, soil conservation, and integrated pest management. The computer and its associated software packages can help you do four kinds of work: (1) store and manipulate records, (2) provide analyses for management decisions, (3) control machines or monitor production, and (4) communicate faster with other people through their computers and data bases. =Recordkeeping= Many experts recommend that you start on a small scale, computerize one thing at a time, and learn as you go along--rather than trying to put information on your entire farm operation into the computer all at once. A good place to start is with farm records. You can use microcomputers to keep track of financial records--such as cash flow, bank balances, accounts payable, accounts receivable, net worth statements, costs, and returns--as well as other records--such as livestock breeding and production reports, crop and field records, and mailing lists. =Farm Management Analysis= After computerizing the farm records, the next step would be to do simple analyses on the microprocessor. A good place to start is by analyzing data already stored in the computer or available in the files. For example, you could use the recordkeeping capabilities of the computer to record and depreciate equipment, and to decide whether it is cheaper to lease or buy farm equipment. General software is available to help you with accounting and bookkeeping, basic business functions. =Process Controllers= Besides analyzing farm management problems and storing data, computers have another key use--as process controllers. They can control such devices as pumps and gates, record milk output per cow, and control grain drying. To save water and energy, some farmers have switched to sophisticated irrigation scheduling by programing their computers to read the moisture in the soil, the weather, and the humidity, and to provide information on a plant's age and irrigation needs. The computer then tells the farmer when to water a crop and for how long--and can even turn the water on and off. =Telecommunications= You can also use a computer as an up-to-date source for communication, linking you to banks of information that are available almost instantaneously from public and private online information sources. With the computer hooked up to the telephone, you can get information quickly, receive it visually, and record it in detail if you wish. Some key information sources are listed on page 20 of this bulletin. =Other Uses= Farm families can use microcomputers the same way other families do--to plan the family budget, keep an inventory of household furnishings, keep track of recipes, keep mailing lists, turn lights and heat on and off, type homework and other documents, learn new skills, and play games. =Computers on the Farm= Most of the computers farmers are getting are microcomputers, also called home computers or personal computers. They are the basis of the \"computer revolution\" that has been occurring since the late 1970's and they are the focus of this publication. Many farmers, especially the owners of the larger farms, already have computers. But you don't have to be a large farmer to afford a microcomputer. Computers can be useful in almost all areas of a farming operation--helping you decide what, when, and how to plant; how to sell; and how to arrange the farm business to be more efficient and more profitable. The computer can supplement the calculator, typewriter, and file cabinet. And it can send and receive written or graphic messages by telephone (in most areas of the country) that might be too long or complex to do verbally. A computer can be very useful when repetitive analyses are needed or when data storage is important, as with financial records or daily milk output per cow.\n",

A computer can be very useful when repetitive analyses are needed or when data storage is important, as with financial records or daily milk output per cow. More and more, farming requires sophisticated management decisions and management of basic resources, including land, water, labor, production inputs, and capital. These are the kinds of decisions the computer can help you make faster and more cost-effectively. Although a computer program for your farm operation could make recordkeeping and analysis easier and improve your ability to manage, it might be hard to measure these improvements in dollars. But the dollars you save by having better information on when to sell a crop, how to monitor the business, and how to diagnose a problem before it gets out of control might pay for the computer. Farmers and ranchers with large feedlot or other livestock operations might find that a feed formulation program could cut costs enough to pay for the computer system within a few months.\n",
      "=How to Choose a Microcomputer System= Should you buy a microcomputer? How do you decide on a system that's best for you? Here are some factors to consider in making these decisions. The first step is to think about your needs. What would you do with your computer system? How would you actually use it to help you run your operation better? List your primary needs, the important things you want to do right away with your computer. Then, think of secondary needs--things you might do in the future once you have a computer. Once you've identified your needs, the next step is to shop around--to find some software that fulfills your needs and to see some systems in operation. Go to computer stores or get in touch with the salespeople in your area. You could decide to have custom programs written for your operation, but they will be significantly more expensive than programs that have already been developed. Talk to other farmers, ranchers, extension and university specialists, and business people who are using microcomputers. Find out what software they are using. Do some research (by reading books or magazines, taking a course or seminar, or visiting a trade show) so you'll be an informed customer when you shop seriously. Many computer experts strongly recommend against buying a computer first and then shopping for the software packages. So identify your needs and select the software packages or materials that will help you do what you want to with your computer. Then find the hardware to run the programs.\n",
      "=The Computer Revolution= \"The advent of computers to farm management... is already underway and seems likely to have a powerful influence,\" said USDA historian Wayne Rasmussen in 1982. \"The computer should lead to more efficient management of machines and energy and should help in other farming operations such as cost accounting, mixing feed rations and applying fertilizers and other resources efficiently. Some farmers now have computers of their own, and many others have access to computer systems through their county agricultural agents,\" Rasmussen pointed out. The computer can be seen as the \"third revolution\" in American farming. The first revolution was the use of the horse, which added animal power to human power. The second was the switch from the horse to the tractor, which again expanded the power an individual could wield. But the computer is a different kind of technological advance because it adds to the farmer's power to manage. By 1990, the computer will probably be as important a part of a commercial farmer's operation as the pickup truck. Farmers may flip on their computers first thing in the morning--instead of their radios--to get the latest market prices. They can get a rundown on weather and growing conditions for major worldwide production areas; pertinent data on prices, market conditions, credit terms, transportation and storage rates, and related forecasts; and finally a list of priorities each day to take advantage of these conditions. Getting the right system--the combination of hardware (the physical equipment) and software (the computer programs)--is the problem farmers must solve before they can make the most of the computer revolution. =Strategies for Getting Into Computers= If you're interested in getting your farm's operations computerized, and you're just starting, you could choose various strategies for doing so. One way is to first buy the basic hardware and components you think you need, and then add memory and other components later. If you do that, be sure you can add additional disk drives, memory, and a printer to your computer, all at a reasonable cost. What can you do with a small computer once you outgrow it, and you want to get a bigger one? You might want to use your older computer in a small, specialized farm operation, or keep it to retrieve and analyze records that you stored on the old equipment. Other alternatives would be to trade it in on a larger computer, advertise to sell it through the local want-ads, trade or sell it to a friend or neighbor, keep the small computer for someone else in the family (perhaps a game-playing youngster), or donate it to a local school or religious or charitable group and take a tax write-off. The farm of the future may have many computers, some for specific functions such as irrigation scheduling or dairy operations, and one for financial records. Having several computers would help farmers deal with the problem of malfunctioning computers, so that the whole farm would not be shut down if one computer goes down.\n",
      "=Alternatives to Buying a Microcomputer= You might consider alternatives to buying a computer. You may be able to lease one to see what it will do for you, and use it until your needs make it worthwhile to buy one. Prices keep coming down. The best time to buy is when you find you can profitably make use of a computer. Even though it becomes technically obsolete, it will still do for you what you purchased it for. A programmable calculator may be an appropriate tool that is much less costly then a microcomputer. If you like what a computer can do for your operation but aren't ready to buy one or to use it yourself, you might hire a consultant to help you select an appropriate system. Or you might retain an accountant or computer consultant to run the financial analysis programs you need. This kind of service gives quick results, and relieves you of having to do it yourself. =Information available From Your County Extension Agent=\n",
      "State Cooperative Extension Services are helping States provide computers for county offices. Many State Extension Services already have computers in nearly every county Extension office. If you are considering buying or leasing a computer system, or want software or timesharing services to make the most of the system you have, a good place to go is to your State or county Extension office. In many States, county Extension offices have terminals connecting them to mainframe computers; some have microcomputers which give them access to information on crop management, animal production, and marketing. The county Extension staff can tell you what is available online in your area that is tailored to your kind of farming and your region. The Extension staff will also be able to tell you the software programs applicable in your State. Many State Extension offices have publications on computers, and others have or are developing online information networks linking farmers and other users to the State university mainframe computer and its data base. State Extension specialists are a logical place to start when looking for software that is appropriate to your needs. Many State Extension computer and agricultural experts have produced software materials that are available, and the county agent will know about them. In some cases the county Extension office can lend you software. If you don't have a computer, the Extension office may be able to run programs for you, choosing the appropriate software available and plugging in the precise conditions and problems on your farming or ranching operation. Or they may be able to use the computer to search for information you need, perhaps communicating with a large State, regional, or national data base. As lower cost computers with improved software have become available, an increasing number of people are turning to their State Cooperative Extension Services for training in computer fundamentals, equipment selection, and software evaluation. County agents can help people find what is available, but they probably will not be preparing software programs themselves. =How to Select Software= The key criteria for selecting good software are the following: Does it meet your needs? Does it do what it says it will do? And does it have good support documentation? =Checklist for Evaluating Software= Here are some factors to consider when evaluating and comparing software: =Documentation.= Look at the \"documentation\" or the written (paper) materials that come with your program. These should explain clearly what the program does and what you have to do to use it. =Ease of Use.= Is the program fairly easy to use? Does it guide you through the program? =Instructions.= Another factor you should consider in evaluating software is the instructions. Are there instructions in the program or in the written documentation? Are they readable? You should be sure you understand how to operate the program. =Help.= What help can you get if you run into problems? Does the program have a \"help\" function? When you don't know how to answer a question or need help, can you turn to a separate part of the computer program or to a part of the accompanying documentation to answer your question? Is there a company phone-in service you can call if you need help? Some software programs may come to you with bugs (errors) in them. Find out what backup services are available. Is there a hotline you can call for help if the program has a problem you can't solve? Does the company provide updated versions periodically? Are they free or at nominal cost? =Compatibility with Hardware.= Is the software compatible with hardware you already have, or does it run on an operating system you can use with your hardware? Some computers use tape cassettes, like audio tape you use on a tape recorder. The most standard storage medium for programs and data is the floppy diskette, which looks like a soft phonograph record. The diskette comes in several sizes--the most common are 8 inches and 51⁄4 inches. A newer possibility is the 8-inch hard disk. The hard disk may be used for storage, but you buy the software on a floppy disk and transfer it. =Memory.= Does your computer have enough memory to run the program? =Recommendation.= Does the program come from a reputable source, or does it come with a recommendation from someone you trust? =Effectiveness.= Does the program do what you want it to do correctly and consistently?\n",
      "=Where to Look for Good Software= Where do you find good software? Some farmers and ranchers write their own programs or pay a programmer to write a custom program. But most get existing programs either from State Extension sources or from commercial outlets. Many operations farmers need to perform on a computer can be done by using generalized software packages readily available through commercial sources. Check with your County Extension Agent. He or she may know of the programs that have been tailored for your operation.\n",
      "The Extension Service has published a directory of agricultural software programs produced by State Extension Services, entitled \"Updated Inventory of Agricultural Computer Programs.\"[A] [Footnote A: To order a copy, send $3.50, payable to the University of Florida, to Administrative Services Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) Bldg. 664 University of Florida Gainesville, FL ] There are also various private directories of software that is compatible for particular equipment. You can get these programs at computer stores or through mail-order sources. Many trade journals carry ads of agricultural software vendors. The land-grant university in your State may have computer programs available for farmers at nominal cost.\n",
      "Many States have produced extensive computer software. There are also many commercial software houses that produce computer programs in the field of agriculture. The best programs are written by people who combine strong expertise in the agricultural subject matter with the ability to write good computer programs that are relatively \"friendly\" or easy to use. The 1980's have seen a big jump in the number, quality, and friendliness of agricultural software. But you still need to evaluate carefully the programs you are considering. Remember that software selection and evaluation are important factors to consider when planning a computer system for your farm. =Compatibility Counts= Computers and marriages should share one thing in common: Compatibility. If it's not there, the system won't work. Not all hardware and software are compatible. In fact, hundreds of producers of computer equipment and computer programs are in the market, and there are few across-the-board standards. So it's important to get hardware and software that are compatible. Software, or the computer programs themselves, are not like records that can be played on any record player. They have to be compatible with the hardware in terms of the programing language used, operating system, size, format, and other factors. Try to find a store in your area where you will get the expertise you need to obtain the right combination of software and hardware to meet your needs. When you buy a computer, find out whether it comes with a standard operating language that will allow you to use a wide variety of programs written in different languages on your computer. Even then, you may find that a disk that supposedly works with that operating language will not work on your machine.\n",
      "=How to Select Hardware= =Checklist for Evaluating Hardware= Here are some factors to consider when evaluating and comparing hardware: =Software.= The first questions to ask are, \"What software do you plan to use?\" and \"Which computer will run that program?\" Does the computer come with a standard operating system so that it will be compatible with a range of software programs? =Memory.= How much memory, or information storage capacity, do you need? The computer's memory is measured in kilobytes (abbreviated K), and most computers come in sizes ranging from 2K up to 256K. (A kilobyte is equal to roughly 1,000 characters.) You need to know the software program you will use and your recordkeeping requirements to accurately estimate the capacity of the equipment you need. Some agricultural programs use 48K or 64K of memory. User friendly programs, which require little training to use and which guide you through the program, may be easier; but they may require more memory for the program itself, leaving you less storage space or memory for the data. =Computation.= What kind of computational ability do you want your computer to have? Will it serve the computing needs you have identified for now and later? =Input and Output Devices.= What kind of output do you need? What additional pieces of equipment or peripherals (such as separate screen, disk drive, modem, printer) will you need to buy to make this system do what you want it to?\n",
      "Most agricultural programs require a printer. A dot matrix printer (which produces characters made of small dots) may be sufficient. Another option is a letter quality printer, which is more expensive. How big a screen do you need? (Screens are measured in characters and in inches.) Do you need an 80-column or 40-column monitor? Do you need color and strong graphics capability? What quality screen image do you need? Can you add memory and other components later if you need to? =External Storage.= What kind of external storage does the system use, floppy disk, hard disk, or tape? Cassette tape storage costs less, but compared to disk storage, it has several disadvantages. If the hardware uses floppy disks, is the disk drive included as part of the computer package or does it come separately? Is a second disk drive included in the package or does it come separately? What kind of a disk drive(s) do you need, single or double density? Hard or floppy? =Training.= What training is available in the use of the new equipment? =Backup and Maintenance Services.= What backup and maintenance services are available from the vendor or other sources, once you've bought this computer? What happens when the computer is down (not working)? Does the company or store from which you plan to buy offer a service contract, and how much does it cost? Will you have to carry your computer to their site for servicing, and how long are you likely to be without it? How far away is your dealer and where will the computer actually be serviced? It's important to buy something that you can have fixed fairly quickly and cheaply, since elements of your system, especially the mechanical parts, may well need repair at some time. =Value.= What equipment and software programs come with the basic package, and are these items included in the base price? Compare prices carefully, considering the components and software you are getting for a particular price. Do not buy on the basis of price alone, but consider also the reliability of the equipment and the vendor, and the service you will be getting to set up, maintain, and support your system.\n",
      "=W\n",
      "here to Look for Good Hardware= Many buyers get their computers at specialty stores that handle computers and other electronics. Some handle only one brand of computer. It's worthwhile to shop around and see various systems. The big national department store chains sell computers, too. Talk to your neighbors about what they're using, and be sure to get hands-on practice with systems you are considering. Try to find a reputable dealer who can offer backup support. Consider the pros and cons of getting all equipment from a single vendor versus shopping around for peripherals from different manufacturers. A reliable dealer who handles several brands can help you make this decision. Check with your Extension office. It may have a State publication on computers or a checklist for buying one.\n",
      "=Types of Hardware= Farmers are using several different types of computers. Besides the microcomputer, which is the most widely used, other kinds of farm computers include interactive terminals, videotex terminals, handheld processors, and minicomputers. A microcomputer can be used as a stand-alone unit, working on its own with a software disk or tape. Or it can be connected to outside information sources if it is equipped with a device known as a modem, which allows the computer to communicate with other computers over the telephone. The modem turns the computer from an information processor and storage machine into a piece of communications equipment. An interactive terminal has no data storage capability but is linked to a central computer through the telephone. This is called a \"dumb\" terminal because it can receive, display, and send information, but it cannot process that information. Programs and data are stored in the central computer and the user pays a fee to access the system. A videotex keyboard terminal can be connected to a telephone jack and any television set. The user can request and receive any kind of information stored in the central computer. Some of the online services use this type of equipment (see section about online information systems on page 20).\n",
      "Many farmers are also using handheld programmable calculators. These are convenient to use in the field, and can record often repeated data, such as daily milk production. They have little memory (usually 2K) and their output can be printed on 2-inch paper tape. They are much cheaper than the microcomputer. Farmers use them to record daily milk production, formulate dairy and beef rations, estimate value of dairy forages, estimate cost of operating farm machinery, and calculate depreciation and investment tax credit. Some very large farm operations use minicomputers, which are larger, have more memory, can do more functions than the microcomputers, and can support multiple users. However, the newer microcomputers have more memory and more functions, and the difference between minicomputers and microcomputers has narrowed. =Computer System Components= [Illustration: Printer; Display Screen; Telephone/Modem; Disk Drive; Floppy Disk; and Central Processor with Keyboard]\n",
      "=Components of a Microcomputer= One way to understand how a microcomputer works is to see its key components. The =central processing unit= (CPU) is the silicon chip that is the \"brain\" of the computer. It does all the computation and controls all the other processing. The CPU stores =memory= of several kinds. Part of the memory is wired into the computer permanently by the manufacturer. This is called Read Only Memory (ROM). It contains such things as the operating system and program language. Random Access Memory (RAM) is the memory bank that includes the computer program or instructions, as well as the data. Your storage devices--tape cassettes, floppy disks, or hard disks--that store computer programs and data, are sometimes called external memory. The computer system also needs =input devices= and =output devices=. Your keyboard is an input device; disk drives and tape drives are also input devices. The output will probably be a cathode ray tube (CRT), which looks like a video monitor. The printer is the other output device you may choose to include in your computer system. Make sure the microcomputer has an adequate number of input and output ports for future needs. If you use your computer for communications, you'll need a telephone =modem=. Here is a possible shopping list of hardware for a farmer's starting microcomputer system: CPU (computer) with 48K or 64K of memory. CRT or monitor with adequate character width for the programs you plan to use. One or two disk drives, either 51⁄4 or 8 inches in diameter. Dot matrix printer (optional). Modem for communication with large computer (optional). =Try it Out= Be sure you try the system you plan to buy. Test run on a sample problem the hardware and software combination you are considering using. See if you think the solutions the computer puts out are what you need. If you insist on a thorough demonstration of the material you are considering buying, you can evaluate it in terms of its ease of use and the usefulness of its analysis. If you're thinking of buying a new software package for a computer you already have, ask to try it out first. Some software distributors in the public sector will give you a trial period to make sure the program is satisfactory and runs on your equipment. Or you may be able to obtain a demonstration disk. At least, try out new programs with the same microprocessor, printer, and screen you use to make sure they will work on your equipment. It's useful to have software evaluated by a reputable source--for example your local county Extension agent, State Extension specialist, or a neighbor who has had experience. \"Let the buyer beware\" is a good motto to remember as you shop around for a computer system. =Getting Comfortable with Computers= If you can use a typewriter, you can use a computer. Most agricultural program's do not require particular math or technical skills, just a knowledge of your farming operation and the ability to think in a logical, orderly way. Most new programs are user friendly; they ask you questions in plain English, and you type the answer on the keyboard. A good way to feel comfortable with computers is to try one out at your local computer store, or at fairs, conferences, or workshops at universities.\n",
      "=Computers Need an Investment in Time and Money= In addition to considering the cost of a computer system, consider the time and effort it takes to learn the equipment and the programs, and to keep records. Who will be operating the microcomputer? Does he or she have the patience and skills to learn to operate the computer, and to enter the large amounts of data that will be required initially? The computer may save time and money. Many farmers find that they don't save time but they accomplish more in the time they do spend. Don't underestimate the amount of time and effort it will require to collect data, make sure it's accurate, enter the data, and run the analyses. It's important to consider how user-friendly the computer is, and how much the computer's software will do to guide you through\n"
