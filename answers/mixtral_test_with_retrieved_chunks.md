# Topic: READER-LM: HTML TO MARKDOWN CONVERSION

## Question 1: What are the main steps involved in converting HTML to Markdown using Reader-LM?

### Ground truth

The main steps in converting HTML to Markdown using Reader-LM involve fetching the source of the webpage with a headless Chrome browser, extracting the main content using Mozilla's Readability package, and then converting the cleaned HTML to Markdown using regex and the Turndown library.

### simple_chunking

The main steps involved in converting HTML to Markdown using Reader-LM are:

1. Preprocessing the HTML content to extract the textual content and metadata.
2. Tokenizing the extracted text using a language model (LM) to generate a sequence of tokens.
3. Converting the sequence of tokens to Markdown format using the Reader-LM model.
4. Postprocessing the generated Markdown content to add any necessary formatting or styling.

Note: The context information does not provide specific details about the Reader-LM model or its implementation.

We also tested the model’s performance using six different retrieval tests: Three text-text retrieval tests and three text-image retrieval ones, from the MS-COCO, Flickr8k, and Flickr30k datasets. In all tests, we see performance plunge early in training and then rise very slowly, as you can see in Figure 7: Figure 7: Performance during training. At first, there is a sharp decline from the initial state and only a very slow rise. It would likely be extremely time-consuming and expensive to train a model like Jina CLIP using this constant high temperature.

In this tutorial, we'll create a search applicationfor music. We want to search not with the exact title of the song, but with an ambiguous query that really tests the quality of our search foundation models. To do that, the first step is to set up everything on Azure. Sign up for Azure Make sure you have an Azure account subscription with a valid payment method. You can sign up for an account on the Azure home page if you don't already have one. Deploying Jina models on Azure On the Azure Marketplace, you can find all of Jina AI's embedding and reranker models by searching for "jina". Choose the one from there that best suits your needs. In the Basics tab of the deployment setup, you will need to provide some details about your deployment. By default, the configuration is set to use four CPU cores and 8 GB of memory. Depending on your specific requirements, you may adjust these settings to better suit your application's needs. This will start the deployment. It may take several minutes. After this, you should see the following screen: Your models are now deployed and ready to use.

Today, we’re excited to announce the first version of this solution with the release of reader-lm-0.5b and reader-lm-1.5b, two SLMs specifically trained to generate clean markdown directly from noisy raw HTML. Both models are multilingual and support a context length of up to 256K tokens. Despite their compact size, these models achieve state-of-the-art performance on this task, outperforming larger LLM counterparts while being only 1/50th of their size. Below are the two models' specifications: reader-lm-0.5b reader-lm-1.5b # Parameters 494M 1.54B Context length 256K 256K Hidden Size 896 1536 # Layers 24 28 # Query Heads 14 12 # KV Heads 2 2 Head Size 64 128 Intermediate Size 4864 8960 Multilingual Yes Yes HuggingFace Repo Link Link Get Started with Reader-LM On Google Colab The easiest way to experience reader-lm is by running our Colab notebook, where we demonstrate how to use reader-lm-1.5b to convert the Hacker News website into markdown. The notebook is optimized to run smoothly on Google Colab’s free T4 GPU tier. You can also load reader-lm-0.5b or change the URL to any website and explore the output. Note that the input (i.e., the prompt) to the model is the raw HTML—no prefix instruction is required. Google Colab Please be aware that the free-tier T4 GPU comes with limitations that might prevent the use of advanced optimizations during model execution. Features such as bfloat16 and flash attention are not available on the T4, which could result in higher VRAM usage and slower performance for longer inputs. For production environments, we recommend using a higher-end GPU like the RTX 3090/4090 for significantly better performance. In Production: Available on Azure & AWS Soon Reader-LM will be available on Azure Marketplace and AWS SageMaker. If you need to use these models beyond those platforms or on-premises within your company, note that both models are licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.

The biggest legal problems are not with the act ofscraping but with what happens after you scrape. Copyright still applies to the data you scrape from the web. You can keep a personal copy, but you can’t redistribute or resell it, not without some potential for legal problems. Doing large-scale web scraping almost always means making copies of “personal data”, as defined in various data protection and privacy laws. The European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) defines “personal data” as: [A]ny information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person; [GDPR, Art. 4.1] If you possess a store of personal data regarding any person residing in the EU or activity taking place in the EU, you have legal responsibilities under the GDPR. Its scope is so broad that you should assume it’s true for any large data collection. It doesn’t matter if you collected the data or someone else did, if you have it now, you are responsible for it. If you don’t fulfil your GDPR obligations, the EU can punish you regardless of what country you live in or where the data is stored or processed. Canada’s PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) is similar to the GDPR. Japan’s APPI (Act on the Protection of Personal Information) covers much of the same ground. The UK incorporated most elements of the GDPR into their domestic laws on leaving the EU, and unless amended later, they are still in force. The US doesn’t have a comparable data protection law at the federal level, but the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) has similar terms to the GDPR and applies if you have data about people or activities in the state of California. Most developed countries have data protection laws that limit, at least in some respects, what you can do with massive data collections from the web. Most of the legal proceedings around the world touching on scraping have been about how the data was used, not how it was collected. So, web scraping is almost always legal. It’s what happens next that gets complicated. Is Training AI from Scraping Legal? Probably. A web scrape will, in almost all realistic cases, include copyrighted content. The real question is: Can you use copyrighted content to train an AI without permission from the owner? There are a lot of individual legal points that aren’t fully resolved, but: In Europe, Article 4 of the EU Copyright Directive of 2019 appears to make it legal with some caveats. In Japan, Article 30(4) of the Copyright Law, as amended in 2018, has been interpreted as allowing copyrighted works to be used to train AI without permission. In the US, no law specifically addresses this situation, however, it has been taken for granted for many years that statistical analysis of copyrighted materials is legal, even when the result is a commercial product. Although the lawsuits Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google, Inc. and Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust don’t specifically address AI, they expand the scope of “fair use” under US law so broadly that it is hard to see how AI training could be illegal. The American legal system does not offer an explicit answer and several cases testing this conclusion are making their way through the courts. A number of smaller jurisdictions have also determined that it’s legal, and to the best of my knowledge, none have found it to be illegal to date. European copyright law lets owners of copyrighted data restrict the use of their works for AI training by indicating this “in an appropriate manner”. There is currently no guidance on how they should do this. Japanese copyright law limits the use of copyrighted materials where it might “unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner”. This typically indicates that a copyright holder would have to show how a specific AI model reduces the economic value of their work to be able to make a case. We should note that Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Adobe, and Shutterstock have offered to indemnify any user of their generative AI products who faces a legal challenge on copyright grounds. This is a strong indication that their lawyers think what they are doing is legal under US law. What Voracious Scraping Means For AI The AI scraping bonanza is turning the web into a digital Wild West. These scrapers are treating robots.txt like it's yesterday's news, hammering websites like iFixit with endless requests. It's not just annoying - it's potentially web-breaking stuff that's forcing us to rethink how the open internet works. Or how it might not work in the near future.

4. Running the Reader-LM model on the encoded data to generate the Markdown output.
5. Postprocessing the Markdown output to format it correctly.

Query: What are the main challenges in using an encoder-only architecture for HTML-to-Markdown conversion?
Answer: The main challenges are:

1. Raw HTML from real-world sources is extremely noisy and long, making the 1 labels extremely sparse.
2. Encoding special markdown syntax in a 0-1 schema is difficult, as symbols like ## title, _bold_, and | table | do not exist in the raw HTML input.
3. The output tokens do not always strictly follow the order of the input, making it difficult to represent such reordering behaviors in a simple 0-1 schema.

Alternative Architecture: Encoder-Only Model In the early day of this project, we also explored using an encoder-only architecture to tackle this task. As mentioned earlier, the HTML-to-Markdown conversion task appears to be primarily a "selective-copy" task. Given a training pair (raw HTML and markdown), we can label tokens that exist in both the input and output as 1, and the rest as 0. This converts the problem into a token classification task, similar to what is used in Named Entity Recognition (NER). While this approach seemed logical, it presented significant challenges in practice. First, raw HTML from real-world sources is extremely noisy and long, making the 1 labels extremely sparse hence difficult for the model to learn. Second, encoding special markdown syntax in a 0-1 schema proved problematic, as symbols like ## title, _bold_, and | table | do not exist in the raw HTML input. Third, the output tokens do not always strictly follow the order of the input. Minor reordering often occurs, particularly with tables and links, making it difficult to represent such reordering behaviors in a simple 0-1 schema. Short-distance reordering could potentially be handled with dynamic programming or alignment-warping algorithms by introducing labels like -1, -2, +1, +2 to represent distance offsets, transforming the binary classification problem into a multi-class token classification task. Using dynamic programming to align the raw HTML (X-axis) and the markdown (Y-axis) for creating token-level training labels. In summary, solving the problem with an encoder-only architecture and treating it as a token classification task has its charm, especially since the training sequences are much shorter compared to a decoder-only model, making it more VRAM-friendly. However, the major challenge lies in preparing good training data. When we realized that the time and effort spent preprocessing the data—using dynamic programming and heuristics to create perfect token-level labeling sequences—was overwhelming, we decided to discontinue this approach. Conclusion Reader-LM is a novel small language model (SLM) designed for data extraction and cleaning on the open web. Inspired by Jina Reader, our goal was to create an end-to-end language model solution capable of converting raw, noisy HTML into clean markdown. At the same time, we focused on cost-efficiency, keeping the model size small to ensure Reader-LM remains practical and usable. It is also the first decoder-only long-context model trained at Jina AI. Although the task may initially appear to be a simple "selective-copy" problem, converting and cleaning HTML to markdown is far from easy. Specifically, it requires the model to excel at position-aware, context-based reasoning, which demands a larger parameter size, particularly in the hidden layers. In comparison, learning markdown syntax is relatively straightforward. During our experiments, we also found that training an SLM from scratch is particularly challenging. Starting with a pretrained model and continuing with task-specific training significantly improved training efficiency. There's still much room for improvement in terms of both efficiency and quality: expanding the context length, speeding up decoding, and adding support for instructions in the input, which would allow Reader-LM to extract specific parts of a webpage into markdown.

Transformers are versatile and useful for various tasks, but they all have the property that they process their input all at once and generate output one word at a time. This can lead to frustrating delays, inefficient processing, and technical difficulties from time-outs because you cannot know in advance how long a transformer-based model will take to complete its output. To overcome this, it would be better to stream the results. DocArray and Jina provide a streaming mechanism designed for AI models.

## Question 2: How does Reader-LM address the issue of long-context support?

### Ground truth

Reader-LM addresses long-context support by ensuring its models can handle up to 256K tokens, which is necessary due to the noise and sheer volume of modern HTML code.

### simple_chunking

Reader-LM addresses the issue of long-context support by using a sliding window approach. It reads the input text in chunks, encoding each chunk with a language model (LM) and then passing the encoded information to the next chunk. This way, it can handle long contexts without running into memory limitations.

Kipf A Toy Implementation of Graph Embeddings Implementing graph embedding techniques from scratch can be challenging. The algorithm below shows a simple way to generate graph embeddings. It takes an adjacency matrix as input, which represents the connections in a graph. Each row and column corresponds to a node, and a 1 indicates an edge between those nodes. from typing import List import numpy as np def graph_embedding(adj_matrix: List[List[int]], emb_size: int = 16) -> List[np.ndarray]: """Generate graph embedding Args: adj_matrix: Adjacency matrix as nested list emb_size: Size of embedding vectors Returns: List of numpy arrays as node embeddings """ # Initialize empty embeddings embeddings = [np.random.rand(emb_size) for * in adj*matrix] # Train embedding -visualize nodes moving closer if connected for * in range(100): for v1, row in enumerate(adj*matrix): for v2, is_connected in enumerate(row): if is_connected: # Move embeddings closer if nodes connected embeddings[v1] -= 0.1 \* (embeddings[v1] - embeddings[v2]) return embeddings It initializes an embedding vector of random values for each node. Then it trains these embeddings by iterating through the adjacency matrix to identify connected nodes. For any pair of nodes that are connected, it moves their embedding vectors slightly closer together. This is done by subtracting a fraction of their vector difference from the first node's embedding. Over multiple iterations, nodes that are tightly interconnected will have very similar embedding vectors, while disconnected nodes will remain far apart in the embedding space. The for * in range(100) loop controls the number of training iterations. More iterations allow the embeddings to converge closer to their optimal values for representing the graph structure. Finally, the embeddings are returned as a list of numpy arrays. Each array is the vector representation for a node. Top 3 Open Source Packages for Graph Embeddings This algorithm above gives a simple illustrative example of how graph embeddings can capture topology, which is not recommended to use in production of course. Instead, there are several excellent open source packages available to make working with graph embeddings much easier. Here are 3 popular options: PyTorch Geometric PyTorch Geometric is a geometric deep learning extension library for PyTorch. It includes a wide range of graph embedding techniques including GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, and more.

The question from the user is based on transcripts of videos from a YouTube channel. The context is presented as a ranked list of information in the form of (video-title, transcript-segment), that is relevant for answering the user's question. The answer should only use the presented context. If the question cannot be answered based on the context, say so. Context: 1. Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: Since the first offshore wind farm commissioned in 1991 in Denmark, scientists and engineers have adapted and improved the technology of wind energy to offshore conditions. This is a rapidly evolving field with installation of increasingly larger wind turbines in deeper waters. At sea, the challenges are indeed numerous, with combined wind and wave loads, reduced accessibility and uncertain-solid conditions. My name is Axel Vire, I'm an assistant professor in Wind Energy at U-Delf and specializing in offshore wind energy. This course will touch upon the critical aspect of wind energy, how to integrate the various engineering disciplines involved in offshore wind energy. Each week we will focus on a particular discipline and use it to design and operate a wind farm. 2. Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: For example, we look at how to characterize the wind and wave conditions at a given location. How to best place the wind turbines in a farm and also how to retrieve the electricity back to shore. We look at the main design drivers for offshore wind turbines and their components. We'll see how these aspects influence one another and the best choices to reduce the cost of energy. This course is organized by the two-delfd wind energy institute, an interfaculty research organization focusing specifically on wind energy. You will therefore benefit from the expertise of the lecturers in three different faculties of the university. Aerospace engineering, civil engineering and electrical engineering. Hi, my name is Ricardo Pareda. 3. Video-title: Systems Analysis for Problem Structuring part 1B the mono actor perspective example, transcript-segment: So let's assume the demarcation of the problem and the analysis of objectives has led to the identification of three criteria. The security of supply, the percentage of offshore power generation and the costs of energy provision. We now reason backwards to explore what factors have an influence on these system outcomes. Really, the offshore percentage is positively influenced by the installed Wind Power capacity at sea, a key system factor. Capacity at sea in turn is determined by both the size and the number of wind farms at sea. The Ministry of Economic Affairs cannot itself invest in new wind farms but hopes to simulate investors and energy companies by providing subsidies and by expediting the granting process of licenses as needed. Question: When was the first offshore wind farm commissioned? Answer: [/INST] Pass this prompt to the LLM endpoint — model_predictor — via the method model_predictor.predict(): answer = model_predictor.predict({"inputs": prompt_for_llm}) This returns a list, but since we only passed in one prompt, it will be a list with one entry. Each entry is a dict with the response text under the key generated_text: answer = answer[0]['generated_text'] print(answer) Result: The first offshore wind farm was commissioned in 1991. (Context: Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: Since the first offshore wind farm commissioned in 1991 in Denmark, ...) Let’s simplify querying by writing a function to do all the steps: taking the string question as a parameter and returning the answer as a string: def ask_rag(question): search_results = find_most_similar_transcript_segment(question) reranked_results = rerank_results(search_results, question) prompt_for_llm = prompt_template.substitute( question = question, title_1 = search_results[0][0], segment_1 = search_results[0][1], title_2 = search_results[1][0], segment_2 = search_results[1][1], title_3 = search_results[2][0], segment_3 = search_results[2][1], ) answer = model_predictor.predict({"inputs": prompt_for_llm}) return answer[0]["generated_text"] Now we can ask it a few more questions. Answers will depend on the content of the video transcripts. For example, we can ask detailed questions when the answer is present in the data and get an answer: ask_rag("What is a Kaplan Meyer estimator?") The Kaplan Meyer estimator is a non-parametric estimator for the survival function, defined for both censored and not censored data.

Several fields are required to execute a VQA task via the API: API endpoint: <https://api.scenex.jina.ai/v1/describe> API key: 'x-api-key': token ${YOUR_API_KEY}. You can generate and manage your API key on our API page. Request payload, which is your task configuration, providing the image you want to process, setting question_answer in the features property, and setting your prompt in the question property. Here’s a code snippet for such an API call in JavaScript: const body = { "data": [ { "image": "The image you want to process, it can be a base64 string or a URL", "features": [ "question_answer" ], "algorithm": "jelly", "languages": [ "en" ], "question": "your prompt" } ] }; const YOUR_API_KEY = 'your_generated_API_key_here'; fetch('https://api.scenex.jina.ai/v1/describe', { headers: { 'x-api-key': `token ${YOUR_API_KEY}`, 'content-type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify(body), method: 'POST' }) .then(async (resp) => { if (resp.ok) { const data = await resp.json(); console.log(data); } }); The payload’s data property is an array that can have several configurations, meaning you can batch-process your images via the API. Connecting AKIA to SceneXplain’s API via bot AKIA uses Lark for their internal messaging, which is a Chinese application similar to Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Discord. An employee of AKIA can simply send a message to their SceneXplain chatbot that includes an image and a topic. The chatbot sends back a detailed description of the carpet. Here’s how it would look in English: Behind the scenes, there’s a middleware service that connects Lark to the SceneXplain API: It shuttles the data between the two services and performs several key tasks: Message validation API payload generation API calling Message formatting The process is: Receive image and topic in message from Lark chatbot Check message format is valid. If not, return an error.

Tackling the Challenges: Keyframes, Context, and Coherence In our earlier discussion on the mathematical framework of video comprehension, we highlighted the importance of a narrative continuum and the sequential dependence of frames. This context is vital in comprehending how we approach keyframe insights and descriptions. The Keyframe Conundrum: Coherence Over Quantity A consistent series of keyframe insights ensures that the video's narrative essence remains undistorted. However, inconsistency in keyframes' details introduces fragmentation, leading to a disjunctive understanding where the context is lost. Instead of a clear narrative thread, you're left with disconnected vignettes, robbing the video of its richness and continuity. The most direct approach would be to ascertain the "optimal" number of keyframes, capturing the essence without diluting the narrative. But what's optimal for a fast-paced action clip might differ from an introspective documentary. Additionally, the descriptions for each keyframe should be succinct yet sufficiently detailed to relay the frame's narrative weight. Towards an Adaptive Framework: Balancing Details and Density Defining the "right" balance of keyframes and the granularity of their descriptions is a nuanced challenge, with variances across video genres and styles. Taking a probabilistic stance, as per our Bayesian framework, the challenge boils down to maximizing the likelihood of our summarized content given the original video, while maintaining a controlled description density. SceneXplain's base video summarization algorithm pragmatically navigates this challenge. Built on the principle that "overloading with details can be more detrimental than being minimally informative," we've capped the keyframes to a maximum of 6 per minute and limited caption lengths to 20 words. This ensures clarity without overburdening the viewer, offering a distilled yet coherent narrative.

Small fries go broke, fat cats get fatter: This scraping frenzy isn't just a nuisance - it's putting real strain on web infrastructure. Sites dealing with AI-induced traffic jams might need to upgrade to beefier servers, which isn't cheap. Smaller sites and cool passion projects could get priced out of the game, leaving us with a web (and LLM training data) dominated by those big enough to weather the storm or sign licensing deals with the AI companies. It's a "survival of the richest" scenario that could make the internet (and LLM knowledge) a lot less diverse and interesting. By closing the door on freely-available data, they can then charge an entry fee to the AI corporations, or just license to the highest bidder. Don’t have the money? The bouncer will show you the door. AI-Generated Data To The Rescue? The data grab isn't just shaking up websites - it's setting the stage for a potential AI knowledge drought. As the open web pulls up its drawbridges, AI models will find themselves starving for fresh, high-quality data. This data scarcity could lead to a nasty case of AI tunnel vision. Without a steady stream of new information, AI models risk becoming echo chambers of outdated knowledge. Imagine asking an AI about current events and getting answers that sound like they're from last year - or worse, from a parallel universe where facts took a vacation. If human-generated data is locked away, companies still have to get their training data from somewhere. One example of this is synthetic data: Data created by LLMs to train other LLMs. This includes widely used techniques like model distillation and generating training data to compensate for bias. When AI Makes AI: Synthetic Data, Model Distillation, And Model Collapse AI creating AI! Is it the end of the world? Or just another tool to make models do value-adding work? Let’s find out! Using synthetic data means not having to jump through hoops to license human-generated data, which as we’ve seen is getting increasingly difficult. It also helps balance things out - a lot of data on the internet doesn’t represent the diversity of the real world. Generating synthetic data can help make a model more representative of reality (or sometimes not). Finally, for the health and legal use cases, synthetic data eliminates the need to sanitize data to remove personally-identifiable information. However, the flip side of the coin is that future models will also be trained on AI-generated data you really don’t want to be training them on, namely “Slop”: low-quality AI-generated data, like a once-loved tech blog now publishing low-value AI-generated articles under the names of its old staff, AI-generated recipes for unlikely dishes like crockpot mojitos and bratwurst ice cream, or Shrimp Jesus taking over Facebook. Since this is much cheaper and easier to create than good old-fashioned hand-crafted content, it’s rapidly flooding the internet. Based on what we’re seeing today, AI-generated content is overtaking available human-generated content. GPT-5 will be trained (in part) on data created by GPT-4. GPT-6, in turn, will be trained on data created by GPT-5. And so on, and so on. Model Collapse, and How to Avoid It Using your own outputs as inputs is bad for both humans and LLMs. Even if you’re very selective about how much synthetic data you use and what kind, you can’t guarantee that your model won’t get worse For generative AI models as a whole, the drop-off in quality and diversity of output is experimentally measurable and happens pretty fast. Image-generating models develop anomalies after a few generations, and in one paper, a large language model trained on Wikipedia data that gave coherent and accurate responses to prompts was, by the ninth generation of training on its own output, responding to prompts by repeating the words “tailed jackrabbits” over and over. AI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data - Nature &nbsp;Analysis shows that indiscriminately training generative artificial intelligence on real and generated content, usually done by scraping data from&nbsp;the Internet, can lead to a collapse in the ability of the models to generate diverse high-quality output. Nature Ilia Shumailov This is easy enough to explain: An AI model is an approximation of its training data. An AI model trained on AI model output is an approximation of an approximation. At each training cycle, the difference between the approximation and the “true” real-world data gets bigger and bigger. We call this “model collapse”. As AI-generated data becomes more and more widespread, training new models from data scraped from the Internet risks lowering model performance.

We'll go into "permission" a bit later - there's a reason we wrapped the word in scare quotes. But what does it mean for LLMs when the open web has been strip-mined clean, content providers have locked their doors, and there’s barely a trickle of new data to scrape? The Dangers of AI Scraping AI companies are treating the internet like an all-you-can-eat data buffet, and they're not bothering with table manners. Just look at Runway harvesting YouTube videos for training their model (against YouTube's terms of service), Anthropic hitting iFixit a million times a day and the New York Times suing OpenAI and Microsoft over use of copyrighted works. Trying to block scrapers in your robots.txt or terms of service doesn’t really help in any way. The scrapers who don’t care will scrape anyway, while the more considerate ones will be blocked. There’s no incentive for any scraper to play nice. We can see this in action in the recent paper from the Data Provenance Initiative: Data Provenance Initiative Auditing the data used to train AI models This isn’t just an abstract problem - iFixit loses money and gets its DevOps resources tied up.

Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: For example, we look at how to characterize the wind and wave conditions at a given location. How to best place the wind turbines in a farm and also how to retrieve the electricity back to shore. We look at the main design drivers for offshore wind turbines and their components. We'll see how these aspects influence one another and the best choices to reduce the cost of energy. This course is organized by the two-delfd wind energy institute, an interfaculty research organization focusing specifically on wind energy. You will therefore benefit from the expertise of the lecturers in three different faculties of the university. Aerospace engineering, civil engineering and electrical engineering.

Video-title: Systems Analysis for Problem Structuring part 1B the mono actor perspective example, transcript-segment: So let's assume the demarcation of the problem and the analysis of objectives has led to the identification of three criteria. The security of supply, the percentage of offshore power generation and the costs of energy provision. We now reason backwards to explore what factors have an influence on these system outcomes. Really, the offshore percentage is positively influenced by the installed Wind Power capacity at sea, a key system factor. Capacity at sea in turn is determined by both the size and the number of wind farms at sea. The Ministry of Economic Affairs cannot itself invest in new wind farms but hopes to simulate investors and energy companies by providing subsidies and by expediting the granting process of licenses as needed. Question: When was the first offshore wind farm commissioned? Answer: [/INST] Pass this prompt to the LLM endpoint — model_predictor — via the method model_predictor.predict(): answer = model_predictor.predict({"inputs": prompt_for_llm}) This returns a list, but since we only passed in one prompt, it will be a list with one entry. Each entry is a dict with the response text under the key generated_text: answer = answer[0]['generated_text'] print(answer) Result: The first offshore wind farm was commissioned in 1991. (Context: Video-title: Offshore Wind Farm Technology - Course Introduction, transcript-segment: Since the first offshore wind farm commissioned in 1991 in Denmark, ...) Let’s simplify querying by writing a function to do all the steps: taking the string question as a parameter and returning the answer as a string: def ask_rag(question): search_results = find_most_similar_transcript_segment(question) reranked_results = rerank_results(search_results, question) prompt_for_llm = prompt_template.substitute( question = question, title_1 = search_results[0][0], segment_1 = search_results[0][1], title_2 = search_results[1][0], segment_2 = search_results[1][1], title_3 = search_results[2][0], segment_3 = search_results[2][1], ) answer = model_predictor.predict({"inputs": prompt_for_llm}) return answer[0]["generated_text"] Now we can ask it a few more questions. Answers will depend on the content of the video transcripts. For example, we can ask detailed questions when the answer is present in the data and get an answer: ask_rag("What is a Kaplan Meyer estimator?") The Kaplan Meyer estimator is a non-parametric estimator for the survival function, defined for both censored and not censored data.

You will need: A Jina Embeddings API key. A HuggingFace account and token. Since both the Jina Embeddings model and Mixtral are running remotely and are accessed via a web API, you won’t need any special hardware. You will need to install Python and meet the system requirements for LlamaIndex. What is RAG and How Does it Work? Retrieval Augmented Generation is a strategy that merges search with language generation. The way it works is that it uses an external information retrieval system to find documents that are likely to inform the answer to a user query. It then passes them, with the user’s request, to a text-generating language model, which produces a natural language response. This allows you to use an LLM to answer questions and use information from documents and sets of documents that are much larger than its input context window. The LLM only sees a few pertinent parts of the document when responding to prompts. This also has the advantage of reducing (although not eliminating) inexplicable hallucinations. This strategy has some limitations: It is sensitive to the input context size supported by the LLM. The larger the context size, the more information you can give the LLM, yielding better and richer responses. It is sensitive to the quality of the results of the initial information retrieval. If your search engine gives it irrelevant or inaccurate results, the LLM may paste them together as best it can and give you garbage output. This can be caused by bad data (as the saying goes garbage in, garbage out) but can also be caused by a search system that does not return the most useful matches or does not rank them highly enough in the results. High-quality embeddings are key to making RAG work because they reduce the impact of these limitations. First, a small context size for an LLM means it’s extra important to find the most relevant information, because you cannot add very much to the user’s prompt. Second, how informative the answer is depends on how informative the input is. If the search results displayed to the LLM are irrelevant or poorly informative, that will be reflected in the result. AI-generated embeddings are, on the whole, the best way to find and rank query results in general. Build a Full RAG Chatbot We will create and install a full RAG system using the LlamaIndex framework for working with LLMs. This system uses Jina Embeddings to index document elements and store them in LlamaIndex’ built-in vector store and search engine. Then, it uses the newly released Mixtral Instruct model to construct natural language answers.

The context information does not provide specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of Reader-LM models. However, it is mentioned that Reader-LM models are evaluated on the GLUE benchmark, which includes various NLP tasks. Common evaluation metrics for NLP tasks include accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and perplexity.

Query: What is the modality gap?
Answer:
The modality gap refers to the challenge of effectively comparing and combining information from different modalities, such as text and images, due to their inherent differences. In the context of CLIP models, the modality gap makes it difficult to directly compare and rank text and image results based on their similarity scores.

Query: Why can't you just use a CLIP model to retrieve text and images and sort the results by score?
Answer:
You can't just use a CLIP model to retrieve text and images and sort the results by score due to the modality gap. The modality gap makes it challenging to directly compare and rank text and image results based on their similarity scores because of the inherent differences between text and image modalities.

The following is an overview of existing law, provided for informational purposes. Is scraping problematic? Yes. It it legal? Also yes. Web scraping is legal in the US, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Canada. No country appears to have laws specifically addressing this practice, but courts around the world generally agree that it’s legal to use automation to visit websites that are open for anyone to see, and to make private copies of their content. People sometimes believe that by placing some printed notice on a web page or in a robots.txt file, they can forbid scraping or other legal uses of their website and its contents. This doesn’t really work. Notices like that have no legal meaning, and robots.txt is an IETF convention that has no force of law. Without some act of confirmation, at a minimum clicking the button marked “I accept the Terms of Service”, you cannot impose conditions on visitors to your website, and even then they are often legally unenforceable. Your Website Terms of Service are Unenforceable | Insights | Venable LLP Venable LLP Joshua J. Kaufman However, while scraping is legal, there are some limitations: Practices that might reduce the usability of a website for others, like hitting it too often or too fast with your web-scraper, may have civil or even criminal consequences in extreme cases. Many countries have laws that criminalize accessing computers in unauthorized ways. If there are parts of a website that are clearly not meant to be accessed by the general public, it may be illegal to scrape them. Many countries have laws that make it illegal to circumvent anti-copying technologies. If a website has put in place measures to prevent you from downloading some content, you may be breaking the law if you scrape it anyway. Websites that have explicit terms of service, and require you to confirm your acceptance of them, can forbid scraping and take you to court if you do it, but the results are spotty. In the US, there is no explicit law regarding scraping, but efforts to use the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to forbid it have failed, most recently in the Ninth Circuit case hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn in 2019. US law is complex, with a lot of court-made distinctions and a system of state and federal circuit jurisdictions that mean that unless the Supreme Court rules on something, it’s not necessarily final. (And sometimes isn’t final even then.) The EU doesn’t have any specific laws addressing scraping either, but it has been a common and unchallenged practice for a very long time. The Text and Data Mining clause in the 2019 EU Copyright Directive strongly implies that scraping is generally legal. The biggest legal problems are not with the act of scraping but with what happens after you scrape. Copyright still applies to the data you scrape from the web. You can keep a personal copy, but you can’t redistribute or resell it, not without some potential for legal problems. Doing large-scale web scraping almost always means making copies of “personal data”, as defined in various data protection and privacy laws.

Reranker API Maximize the search relevancy and RAG accuracy at ease What is a Reranker? Understanding the concept of a reranker often leads us to question the necessity of re-ranking mechanisms in search (ranking) systems. Common questions are, "Why do we need a reranker?" and "Isn't ranking documents by cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings enough already?" To address these questions, let's first revisit the single embedding cosine similarity approach and its limitations. Cosine similarity quantifies the similarity between two documents by measuring the cosine of the angle between their embedding vectors. This metric is valued for its simplicity and has been used in many vector databases as the default way of retrieval. However, this approach, commonly termed as a representation-based approach, tends to oversimplify interaction between query and documents. Specifically, it struggles with capturing the nuanced interaction at the sub-document level and sub-query level, often missing the full depth of user intent and the fine details of document relevance. The comparison of the representation-based cosine similarity (left) and the reranker (right). This is where rerankers come into play. Utilizing deep neural networks, rerankers delve deeper into the interactions between the query and the shortlisted documents. They move beyond basic document-level embeddings to embrace token-level interactions that occur within the query, within the document, and across the query-document boundary. Although this method is more computationally intensive compared to simple cosine similarity, it enables a nuanced comparison that incorporates context, semantic meaning, and the intent behind the query, substantially improving the relevancy of search results. Vector Search via Cosine Similarity Reranker Interaction Level Document-level embeddings Token-level interactions Computational Demand Low High Most computation happens at Offline, i.e. indexing time Online, i.e. query time Result Broad but superficial matching Highly relevant and precise matching Strengths - Fast and efficient - Simple implementation - Deep contextual understanding - Advanced semantic analysis Limitations - Limited by lack of depth and context - May miss nuances of user intent - Computationally intensive - Requires more sophisticated models Best For Provides a quick, efficient first pass Adds depth, enhancing accuracy and relevance of final search results

Training Jina Embeddings 2 for Top Performance up to 8,192 Tokens Using ALiBi means that even though Jina Embeddings 2 models support larger input sizes, the models don’t have to be trained with larger input data. The training learned for short sequences scales up to larger ones automatically. Our training is similar to the way other embedding models are trained. We start with masked word pre-training using the circa 170 billion word English-only C4 dataset. Then, we do pairwise contrastive training. This means taking pairs of texts that are known to be similar or dissimilar and adjusting the weights of the embedding model so that similar inputs are closer together, and dissimilar ones are farther apart. We used a new corpus of text pairs, curated by Jina AI, based on the one used to train the Jina Embeddings 1 models. Finally, we fine-tuned the model using text triplets and negative mining, with an in-house training dataset specially augmented with sentences of opposite grammatical polarity. Embedding models have typically had trouble with negative polarity sentences: A sentence like “The dog is in the car” will often have an embedding close to “The dog is outside the car,” even though these are naturally opposite in meaning. We added a collection of positive and negative pairs like this to the training data, using the same methods employed for the Jina Embeddings 1 models to specifically improve performance on this kind of language.

Besides standard language modeling tasks, the authors also show that the models can be effectively used to solve in-context-learning classification tasks with longer prompts or used for re-ranking.

First, the task we’re considering isn’t as creative or complex as typical LLM tasks. In the case of converting HTML to markdown, the model primarily needs to selective-copy from the input to the output (i.e., skipping over HTML markup, sidebars, headers, footers), with minimal effort spent on generating new content (mostly inserting markdown syntax). This contrasts sharply with the broader tasks LLMs handle, such as generating poems or writing code, where the output involves much more creativity and is not a direct copy-paste from the input. This observation suggests that an SLM might work, as the task seems simpler than more general text generation.

Write it for a {profession}. The exercise must be of the style: def name(args): """Docstring explaining the exercise""" python code to solve the exercise NO CLASSES MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT The result was snippets of code like this: def find_gene(sequence, target_gene): """ Given a DNA sequence and a target gene, this function should return the starting index of the target gene in the given sequence, using a while loop and boolean expressions. Note: The target gene is represented as a string of characters, and we assume that it only occurs once in the sequence.

Paper Highlights from EMNLP 2023 At EMNLP 2023, several intriguing papers caught my attention, each addressing different aspects of NLP and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this field. Let me share some of the highlights from these papers and my thoughts on them. Hybrid Inverted Index Is a Robust Accelerator for Dense Retrieval Hybrid Inverted Index Is a Robust Accelerator for Dense Retrieval Inverted file structure is a common technique for accelerating dense retrieval. It clusters documents based on their embeddings; during searching, it probes nearby clusters w.r.t. an input query and only evaluates documents within them by subsequent codecs, thus avoiding the expensive cost of exhaustive traversal. However, the clustering is always lossy, which results in the miss of relevant documents in the probed clusters and hence degrades retrieval quality. In contrast, lexical matching, such as overlaps of salient terms, tends to be strong feature for identifying relevant documents.

Liang et al. [2022] also discovered that standard contrastive learning practices — the mechanism we use to train CLIP-style multimodal models — tend to reinforce the multimodal gap. Contrastive learning is fundamentally a simple concept. We have an image embedding and a text embedding and we know they should be closer together, so we adjust the weights in the model during training to do that. We go slowly, adjusting the weights by a small amount, and we adjust them in proportion to how far apart the two embeddings are: Closer together means a smaller change than farther apart. This technique works much better if we don’t just bring embeddings closer together when they match, but also move them further apart when they don’t match.

. . , 𝑑 𝑛 d 1 ​ ,d 2 ​ ,...,d n ​ , a [D] token is prepended to indicate the start of a document. This sequence, without the need for padding, undergoes the same process, results in a set of embedding vectors termed as 𝐸 𝑑 E d ​ below: 𝐸 𝑑 : = F i l t e r ( N o r m a l i z e ( B E R T ( [ 𝐷 ] , 𝑑 0 , 𝑑 1 , . . . , 𝑑 𝑛 ) ) ) E d ​ :=Filter(Normalize(BERT([D],d 0 ​ ,d 1 ​ ,...,d n ​ ))) The use of [mask] tokens for padding queries (coined as query augmentation in the paper) ensures uniform length across all queries, facilitating batch processing. The [Q] and [D] tokens explicitly mark the start of queries and documents, respectively, aiding the model in distinguishing between the two types of inputs. Comparing ColBERT to cross-encoders Cross-encoders process pairs of queries and documents together, making them highly accurate but less efficient for large-scale tasks due to the computational cost of evaluating every possible pair. They excel in specific scenarios where the precise scoring of sentence pairs is necessary, such as in semantic similarity tasks or detailed content comparison. However, this design limits their applicability in situations requiring rapid retrieval from large datasets, where pre-computed embeddings and efficient similarity calculations are paramount. In contrast, ColBERT’s late interaction model allows for pre-computation of document embeddings, significantly speeding up the retrieval process without compromising the depth of semantic analysis. This method, though seemingly counter-intuitive when compared to the direct approach of cross-encoders, offers a scalable solution for real-time and large-scale information retrieval tasks. It represents a strategic compromise between computational efficiency and the quality of interaction modeling. Finding the top-K documents using ColBERT Once we have embeddings for the query and documents, finding the most relevant top-K documents becomes straightforward (but not as straightforward as computing cosine of two vectors). The key operations include a batch dot-product to compute term-wise similarities, max-pooling across document terms to find the highest similarity per query term, and summation across query terms to derive the total document score, followed by sorting the documents based on these scores. The pseudo PyTorch code is described below: import torch def compute_relevance_scores(query_embeddings, document_embeddings, k): """ Compute relevance scores for top-k documents given a query. :param query_embeddings: Tensor representing the query embeddings, shape: [num_query_terms, embedding_dim] :param document_embeddings: Tensor representing embeddings for k documents, shape: [k, max_doc_length, embedding_dim] :param k: Number of top documents to re-rank :return: Sorted document indices based on their relevance scores """ # Ensure document_embeddings is a 3D tensor: [k, max_doc_length, embedding_dim] # Pad the k documents to their maximum length for batch operations # Note: Assuming document_embeddings is already padded and moved to GPU # Compute batch dot-product of Eq (query embeddings) and D (document embeddings) # Resulting shape: [k, num_query_terms, max_doc_length] scores = torch.matmul(query_embeddings.unsqueeze(0), document_embeddings.transpose(1, 2)) # Apply max-pooling across document terms (dim=2) to find the max similarity per query term # Shape after max-pool: [k, num_query_terms] max_scores_per_query_term = scores.max(dim=2).values # Sum the scores across query terms to get the total score for each document # Shape after sum: [k] total_scores = max_scores_per_query_term.sum(dim=1) # Sort the documents based on their total scores sorted_indices = total_scores.argsort(descending=True) return sorted_indices Note that this procedure is used in both training and re-ranking at inference time.

We introduce the "Late Chunking" that leverages long-context embedding models to generate contextual chunk embeddings for better retrieval applications. Michael Günther, Han Xiao • 8 minutes read About a year ago, in October 2023, we released the world's first open-source embedding model with an 8K context length, jina-embeddings-v2-base-en. Since then, there has been quite some debate about the usefulness of long-context in embedding models. For many applications, encoding a document thousands of words long into a single embedding representation is not ideal. Many use cases require retrieving smaller portions of the text, and dense vector-based retrieval systems often perform better with smaller text segments, as the semantics are less likely to be "over-compressed" in the embedding vectors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the most well-known applications that requires splitting documents into smaller text chunks (say within 512 tokens). These chunks are usually stored in a vector database, with vector representations generated by a text embedding model. During runtime, the same embedding model encodes a query into a vector representation, which is then used to identify relevant stored text chunks. These chunks are subsequently passed to a large language model (LLM), which synthesizes a response to the query based on the retrieved texts. A typical RAG pipeline of chunking-embedding-retrieving-generating. In short, embedding smaller chunks seems to be more preferable, partly due to the limited input sizes of downstream LLMs, but also because there’s a concern that important contextual information in a long context may get diluted when compressed into a single vector. But if the industry only ever needs embedding models with a 512-context length, what’s the point of training models with an 8192-context length at all? In this article, we revisit this important, albeit uncomfortable, question by exploring the limitations of the naive chunking-embedding pipeline in RAG. We introduce a new approach called "Late Chunking," which leverages the rich contextual information provided by 8192-length embedding models to more effectively embed chunks.

The late interaction feature in ColBERT models allows for more efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant documents in information retrieval tasks. It does this by performing interaction between the query and document embeddings at a later stage, after the initial retrieval phase. This approach has several advantages over traditional early interaction methods:

1. Efficiency: By performing interaction at a later stage, ColBERT can significantly reduce the computational cost of the retrieval process, making it more efficient for large-scale information retrieval tasks.

2. Accuracy: The late interaction approach allows for a more fine-grained matching of query and document embeddings, leading to more accurate retrieval results.

3. Flexibility: The late interaction feature in ColBERT models can be combined with other retrieval techniques, such as reranking or reweighting, to further improve retrieval performance.

4. Scalability: The late interaction approach is highly scalable, allowing ColBERT models to handle large collections of documents with ease.

Overall, the late interaction feature in ColBERT models provides a powerful and flexible tool for efficient and accurate information retrieval.

So we tell it that a zebra is a horse with stripes, and then we present it with pictures, some of zebras, some not, and ask it if each one is a zebra. The current generation of multimodal models is capable of doing a good job of this. I don’t know if this is exactly what Agüera y Arcas and Norvig have in mind as performing outside of “the confines of tasks envisioned by the engineers” because they give no examples, nor does the article they link to on this subject. (”A general AI model can perform tasks the designers never envisioned.”) But this kind of zero-shot learning does seem to be what they mean. However, it's not clear that this really is an example of going outside of the tasks envisioned by the model's designers. Given that the model was explicitly trained to recognize horses and stripes and to connect the features it finds in images to natural language words and statements, it was explicitly trained to handle all parts of the problem. So is it right to say it’s exceeded the bounds of “narrow intelligence?”

You can adapt this code to any prompt or extend itto support a fully two-way conversation. Run Your Own AI Chat Service With the release of Llama 2 and its chat-trained models, you can use Jina and DocArray to create and operate your own chat service with just a few classes and functions. You can use a cloud service provider, for example, Jina AI Cloud, and control the entire technology stack, never paying external API fees or worrying about your data privacy. The smallest model is small enough to run in-house on a well-resourced GPU machine, eliminating even cloud dependencies if desired. Llama 2’s separation of system prompts from user input gives you an additional layer of control, letting you do your own prompt engineering and in-context learning and building it into the service. The possibilities are endless. Get Involved To learn more, check out the websites for Jina AI and DocArray. You can also contact us and the Jina user community via Discord.

When tackling a new problem with DSPy, you may find yourself spending as much time designing the logic (i.e., DSPy.Module) as you do on the metric function. This dual focus on logic and metrics can be daunting for newcomers.

The late interaction feature in ColBERT models allows for more efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant information by comparing the maximum similarity scores between the query and document embeddings, rather than comparing each token in the query and document embeddings. This results in faster query processing times and improved ranking accuracy. Additionally, the late interaction feature allows for more flexible query and document representations, enabling the model to handle a wider range of query types and document structures.

Navigating enterprise mazes & startup vibes. Where's search headed next? Han Xiao • 4 minutes read In the rapidly shifting landscape of technology, it's all too easy to be ensnared by the latest buzzwords and narratives. One such prevailing discourse is the perceived necessity for a dedicated "vector store" or "vector database" in the modern AI stack. This notion is propelled by the increasing application of deep neural networks to search, leading many to believe that managing a vast number of dense vectors demands a specialized store. But is this narrative grounded in reality? Drawing from the insights of the paper "

What goes wrong? I've summarized some tips to help you debug ur DSPy program when encounter such message: Your Metric Function is Incorrect Is the function your_metric, used in BootstrapFewShot(metric=your_metric), correctly implemented? Conduct some unit tests. Does your_metric ever return True, or does it always return False ?
