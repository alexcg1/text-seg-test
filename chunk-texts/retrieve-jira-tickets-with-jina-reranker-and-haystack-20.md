To follow this tutorial, you'll need a Jina Reranker API key. You can create one with a free trial quota of a million tokens from the Jina Reranker website. ðŸ’¡ You can follow along in Colab or by downloading the notebook.

This should create a progress bar and output a brief JSON containing information about what's been stored: Calculating embeddings: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 1/1 [00:01<00:00, 1.21s/it] {'embedder': {'meta': {'model': 'jina-embeddings-v2-base-en', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 20067, 'prompt_tokens': 20067}}}, 'writer': {'documents_written': 31}} Build the Query Pipeline Letâ€™s create a query pipeline so we can start comparing tickets. In Haystack 2.0 retrievers are tightly coupled to DocumentStores. If we pass the document store in the retriever we initialized earlier, this pipeline can access the documents we generated, and pass them to the reranker. The reranker then compares these documents directly with the question and ranks them based on relevance. We first define the custom cleaner to remove retrieve tickets that contain either the same issue ID or parent ID as the issue passed as query: from typing import Optional @component class RemoveRelated: @component.output_types(documents=List[Document]) def run(self, tickets: List[Document], query_id: Optional[str]): retrieved_tickets = [] for t in tickets: if not t.meta['Issue id'] == query_id and not t.meta['Parent id'] == query_id: retrieved_tickets.append(t) return {'documents': retrieved_tickets} We then embed the query, retrieve relevant documents, clean the selection, and finally rerank it: from haystack_integrations.components.embedders.jina import JinaTextEmbedder from haystack_integrations.components.rankers.jina import JinaRanker query_pipeline_reranker = Pipeline() query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_embedder_reranker', JinaTextEmbedder(model='jina-embeddings-v2-base-en')) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_retriever_reranker', retriever_reranker) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_cleaner_reranker', RemoveRelated()) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_ranker_reranker', JinaRanker()) query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_embedder_reranker.embedding', 'query_retriever_reranker.query_embedding') query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_retriever_reranker', 'query_cleaner_reranker') query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_cleaner_reranker', 'query_ranker_reranker') To highlight the difference caused by the reranker, we analyzed the same pipeline without the final reranking step (the corresponding code was omitted in this post for the sake of readability but can be found in the notebook): To compare the results of these two pipelines, we now define our query in the form of an existing ticket, here "ZOOKEEPER-3282": query_ticket_key = 'ZOOKEEPER-3282' with open('tickets.json', 'r') as file: tickets = json.load(file) for ticket in tickets: if ticket['Issue key'] == query_ticket_key: query = str(ticket) query_ticket_id = ticket['Issue id'] It concerns "a big refactor for the documetations" [sic]. You'll see that, despite the misspelling, Jina Reranker will correctly retrieve similar tickets. { "Summary": "a big refactor for the documetations" "Issue key": "ZOOKEEPER-3282" "Issue id:: 13216608 "Parent id": "" "Issue Type": "Task" "Status": "In Progress" "Project lead": "phunt" "Priority": "Major" "Assignee": "maoling" "Reporter": "maoling" "Creator": "maoling" "Created": "19/Feb/19 11:50" "Updated": "04/Aug/19 12:48" "Last Viewed": "12/Mar/24 11:56" "Description": "Hi guys: I'am working on doing a big refactor for the documetations.it aims to - 1.make a better reading experiences and help users know more about zookeeper quickly,as good as other projects' doc(e.g redis,hbase). - 2.have less changes to diff with the original docs as far as possible. - 3.solve the problem when we have some new features or improvements,but cannot find a good place to doc it.

In this case, it retrieves 20 tickets, eliminates ID-related entries, reranks them, and outputs the final selection of the 10 most relevant issues.

The results above clearly show the necessity for both Jina Embeddings to retrieve relevant documents through vector search, and Jina Reranker to finally obtain the most relevant content. If we take, for example, the two issues that relate to adding documentation, i.e. "ZOOKEEPER-3585" and "ZOOKEEPER-3587", we see that after the retrieval step, they are both correctly included in positions 11 and 9 respectively. After reranking the documents, they are now both within the top 5 most relevant documents at positions 5 and 1 respectively, showing a significant improvement. By integrating both models in Haystack's pipelines, the entire tool is ready for use. This combination makes the Jina Haystack extension the perfect solution for your application.

Haystack, the composable open-source AI framework Haystack In this post, we'll show how to use them to create your own Jira ticket search engine to streamline your operations and never again waste time creating duplicate issues. To follow this tutorial, you'll need a Jina Reranker API key. You can create one with a free trial quota of a million tokens from the Jina Reranker website. ðŸ’¡ You can follow along in Colab or by downloading the notebook. Retrieving Jira Support Tickets Any team dealing with a complex project has experienced the frustration of having an issue they want to file but not knowing if a ticket already exists for this problem. In the following tutorial, we'll show you how you can easily create a tool yourself using Jina Reranker and Haystack pipelines, which suggests possible duplicate tickets to a new one being created. By inputting a ticket that needs to be checked against all existing tickets, the pipeline will first retrieve from the database all related issues. It'll then remove the initial ticket from the list (if it already existed in the database) and any child ticket (i.e. tickets whose parent ID corresponds to the original ticket). The final selection now only comprises issues that might cover the same topic as the original ticket but were not marked as such in the database through their IDs. These tickets are reranked to ensure maximal relevance and enable you to identify duplicate entries in the database.

Getting the Dataset To implement our solution, we've chosen all "In-progress" Jira tickets for the Apache Zookeeper project. This is an open-source service for coordinating processes of distributed applications. We have placed the tickets in a JSON file to make them more convenient. Please download the file to your workspace. Set up the Prerequisites To install the requirements, run: pip install --q chromadb haystack-ai jina-haystack chroma-haystack To input the API key, set it as an environment variable: import os import getpass os.environ["JINA_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass() ðŸ’¡ If you're running this code through the notebook, getpass.getpass() will prompt you to input the API key below the corresponding code block. You can enter the key there and press enter to resume the tutorial. If you prefer, you can also substitute getpass.getpass() with the API key itself. Build the Indexing Pipeline The indexing pipeline will preprocess the tickets, turn them into vectors, and store them. Weâ€™ll use the Chroma DocumentStore as our vector database to store the vector embeddings, via the Chroma Document Store Haystack integration. from haystack_integrations.document_stores.chroma import ChromaDocumentStore document_store = ChromaDocumentStore() We'll start by defining our custom data preprocessor to only consider relevant document fields and delete all empty entries: import json from typing import List from haystack import Document, component relevant_keys = ['Summary', 'Issue key', 'Issue id', 'Parent id', 'Issue type', 'Status', 'Project lead', 'Priority', 'Assignee', 'Reporter', 'Creator', 'Created', 'Updated', 'Last Viewed', 'Due Date', 'Labels', 'Description', 'Comment', 'Comment__1', 'Comment__2', 'Comment__3', 'Comment__4', 'Comment__5', 'Comment__6', 'Comment__7', 'Comment__8', 'Comment__9', 'Comment__10', 'Comment__11', 'Comment__12', 'Comment__13', 'Comment__14', 'Comment__15'] @component class RemoveKeys: @component.output_types(documents=List[Document]) def run(self, file_name: str): with open(file_name, 'r') as file: tickets = json.load(file) cleaned_tickets = [] for t in tickets: t = {k: v for k, v in t.items() if k in relevant_keys and v} cleaned_tickets.append(t) return {'documents': cleaned_tickets} We then need to create a custom JSON converter to transform the tickets into Document objects Haystack can understand: @component class JsonConverter: @component.output_types(documents=List[Document]) def run(self, tickets: List[Document]): tickets_documents = [] for t in tickets: if 'Parent id' in t: t = Document(content=json.dumps(t), meta={'Issue key': t['Issue key'], 'Issue id': t['Issue id'], 'Parent id': t['Parent id']}) else: t = Document(content=json.dumps(t), meta={'Issue key': t['Issue key'], 'Issue id': t['Issue id'], 'Parent id': ''}) tickets_documents.append(t) return {'documents': tickets_documents} Finally, we embed the Documents and write these embeddings into the ChromaDocumentStore: from haystack import Pipeline from haystack.components.writers import DocumentWriter from haystack_integrations.components.retrievers.chroma import ChromaEmbeddingRetriever from haystack.document_stores.types import DuplicatePolicy from haystack_integrations.components.embedders.jina import JinaDocumentEmbedder retriever = ChromaEmbeddingRetriever(document_store=document_store) retriever_reranker = ChromaEmbeddingRetriever(document_store=document_store) indexing_pipeline = Pipeline() indexing_pipeline.add_component('cleaner', RemoveKeys()) indexing_pipeline.add_component('converter', JsonConverter()) indexing_pipeline.add_component('embedder', JinaDocumentEmbedder(model='jina-embeddings-v2-base-en')) indexing_pipeline.add_component('writer', DocumentWriter(document_store=document_store, policy=DuplicatePolicy.SKIP)) indexing_pipeline.connect('cleaner', 'converter') indexing_pipeline.connect('converter', 'embedder') indexing_pipeline.connect('embedder', 'writer') indexing_pipeline.run({'cleaner': {'file_name': 'tickets.json'}}) This should create a progress bar and output a brief JSON containing information about what's been stored: Calculating embeddings: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 1/1 [00:01<00:00, 1.21s/it] {'embedder': {'meta': {'model': 'jina-embeddings-v2-base-en', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 20067, 'prompt_tokens': 20067}}}, 'writer': {'documents_written': 31}} Build the Query Pipeline Letâ€™s create a query pipeline so we can start comparing tickets. In Haystack 2.0 retrievers are tightly coupled to DocumentStores. If we pass the document store in the retriever we initialized earlier, this pipeline can access the documents we generated, and pass them to the reranker. The reranker then compares these documents directly with the question and ranks them based on relevance. We first define the custom cleaner to remove retrieve tickets that contain either the same issue ID or parent ID as the issue passed as query: from typing import Optional @component class RemoveRelated: @component.output_types(documents=List[Document]) def run(self, tickets: List[Document], query_id: Optional[str]): retrieved_tickets = [] for t in tickets: if not t.meta['Issue id'] == query_id and not t.meta['Parent id'] == query_id: retrieved_tickets.append(t) return {'documents': retrieved_tickets} We then embed the query, retrieve relevant documents, clean the selection, and finally rerank it: from haystack_integrations.components.embedders.jina import JinaTextEmbedder from haystack_integrations.components.rankers.jina import JinaRanker query_pipeline_reranker = Pipeline() query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_embedder_reranker', JinaTextEmbedder(model='jina-embeddings-v2-base-en')) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_retriever_reranker', retriever_reranker) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_cleaner_reranker', RemoveRelated()) query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_ranker_reranker', JinaRanker()) query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_embedder_reranker.embedding', 'query_retriever_reranker.query_embedding') query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_retriever_reranker', 'query_cleaner_reranker') query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_cleaner_reranker', 'query_ranker_reranker')

To highlight the difference caused by the reranker,we analyzed the same pipeline without the final reranking step (the corresponding code was omitted in this post for the sake of readability but can be found in the notebook):

To compare the results of these two pipelines, we now define our query in the form of an existing ticket, here "ZOOKEEPER-3282": query_ticket_key = 'ZOOKEEPER-3282' with open('tickets.json', 'r') as file: tickets = json.load(file) for ticket in tickets: if ticket['Issue key'] == query_ticket_key: query = str(ticket) query_ticket_id = ticket['Issue id'] It concerns "a big refactor for the documetations" [sic]. You'll see that, despite the misspelling, Jina Reranker will correctly retrieve similar tickets.

Retrieve Jira Tickets with Jina Reranker and Haystack 2.0


Learn how to use Jina Reranker and Embeddings with Haystack to create your own Jira ticket search engine, streamlining your operations and never again waste time creating duplicate issues.


Francesco Kruk â€¢ 10 minutes read



Following the integration of Jina Embeddings into Deepset's Haystack 2.0 and the release of Jina Reranker, we're thrilled to announce that Jina Reranker is now also available through the Jina Haystack extension.

Reranker API


Maximize the search relevancy and RAG accuracy at ease



Haystack is an end-to-end framework that accompanies you in every step of the GenAI project life cycle. Whether you want to perform document search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), question answering, or answer generation, Haystack can orchestrate state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs into pipelines to build end-to-end NLP applications and solve your use case.

Haystack



In this post, we'll show how to use them to create your own Jira ticket search engine to streamline your operations and never again waste time creating duplicate issues.



To follow this tutorial, you'll need a Jina Reranker API key. You can create one with a free trial quota of a million tokens from the Jina Reranker website.



You can follow along in Colab or by downloading the notebook.


Retrieving Jira Support Tickets



Any team dealing with a complex project has experienced the frustration of having an issue they want to file but not knowing if a ticket already exists for this problem.



In the following tutorial, we'll show you how you can easily create a tool yourself using Jina Reranker and Haystack pipelines, which suggests possible duplicate tickets to a new one being created.



By inputting a ticket that needs to be checked against all existing tickets, the pipeline will first retrieve from the database all related issues.


It'll then remove the initial ticket from the list (if it already existed in the database) and any child ticket (i.e. tickets whose parent ID corresponds to the original ticket).


The final selection now only comprises issues that might cover the same topic as the original ticket but were not marked as such in the database through their IDs. These tickets are reranked to ensure maximal relevance and enable you to identify duplicate entries in the database.


Getting the Dataset



To implement our solution, we've chosen all "In-progress" Jira tickets for the Apache Zookeeper project. This is an open-source service for coordinating processes of distributed applications.



We have placed the tickets in a JSON file to make them more convenient. Please download the file to your workspace.



Set up the Prerequisites



To install the requirements, run:



pip install --q chromadb haystack-ai jina-haystack chroma-haystack




To input the API key, set it as an environment variable:



import os


import getpass



os.environ["JINA_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()



If you're running this code through the notebook, getpass.getpass() will prompt you to input the API key below the corresponding code block. You can enter the key there and press enter to resume the tutorial. If you prefer, you can also substitute getpass.getpass() with the API key itself.


Build the Indexing Pipeline



The indexing pipeline will preprocess the tickets, turn them into vectors, and store them. Weâ€™ll use the Chroma DocumentStore as our vector database to store the vector embeddings, via the Chroma Document Store Haystack integration.



from haystack_integrations.document_stores.chroma import ChromaDocumentStore



document_store = ChromaDocumentStore()




We'll start by defining our custom data preprocessor to only consider relevant document fields and delete all empty entries:



import json


from typing import List


from haystack import Document, component



relevant_keys = ['Summary', 'Issue key', 'Issue id', 'Parent id', 'Issue type', 'Status', 'Project lead', 'Priority', 'Assignee', 'Reporter', 'Creator', 'Created', 'Updated', 'Last Viewed', 'Due Date', 'Labels',


                 'Description', 'Comment', 'Comment__1', 'Comment__2', 'Comment__3', 'Comment__4', 'Comment__5', 'Comment__6', 'Comment__7', 'Comment__8', 'Comment__9', 'Comment__10', 'Comment__11', 'Comment__12',
                 'Comment__13', 'Comment__14', 'Comment__15']


@component


class RemoveKeys:


    @component.output_types(documents=List[Document])
    def run(self, file_name: str):
        with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
            tickets = json.load(file)
        cleaned_tickets = []
        for t in tickets:
            t = {k: v for k, v in t.items() if k in relevant_keys and v}
            cleaned_tickets.append(t)
        return {'documents': cleaned_tickets}


We then need to create a custom JSON converter to transform the tickets into Document objects Haystack can understand:



@component


class JsonConverter:


    @component.output_types(documents=List[Document])
    def run(self, tickets: List[Document]):
        tickets_documents = []
        for t in tickets:
            if 'Parent id' in t:
                t = Document(content=json.dumps(t), meta={'Issue key': t['Issue key'], 'Issue id': t['Issue id'], 'Parent id': t['Parent id']})
            else:
                t = Document(content=json.dumps(t), meta={'Issue key': t['Issue key'], 'Issue id': t['Issue id'], 'Parent id': ''})
            tickets_documents.append(t)
        return {'documents': tickets_documents}


Finally, we embed the Documents and write these embeddings into the ChromaDocumentStore:



from haystack import Pipeline



from haystack.components.writers import DocumentWriter


from haystack_integrations.components.retrievers.chroma import ChromaEmbeddingRetriever


from haystack.document_stores.types import DuplicatePolicy



from haystack_integrations.components.embedders.jina import JinaDocumentEmbedder



retriever = ChromaEmbeddingRetriever(document_store=document_store)


retriever_reranker = ChromaEmbeddingRetriever(document_store=document_store)



indexing_pipeline = Pipeline()


indexing_pipeline.add_component('cleaner', RemoveKeys())


indexing_pipeline.add_component('converter', JsonConverter())


indexing_pipeline.add_component('embedder', JinaDocumentEmbedder(model='jina-embeddings-v2-base-en'))


indexing_pipeline.add_component('writer', DocumentWriter(document_store=document_store, policy=DuplicatePolicy.SKIP))



indexing_pipeline.connect('cleaner', 'converter')


indexing_pipeline.connect('converter', 'embedder')


indexing_pipeline.connect('embedder', 'writer')



indexing_pipeline.run({'cleaner': {'file_name': 'tickets.json'}})




This should create a progress bar and output a brief JSON containing information about what's been stored:



Calculating embeddings: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 1/1 [00:01<00:00,  1.21s/it]


{'embedder': {'meta': {'model': 'jina-embeddings-v2-base-en',


'usage': {'total_tokens': 20067, 'prompt_tokens': 20067}}},

'writer': {'documents_written': 31}}

Build the Query Pipeline



Letâ€™s create a query pipeline so we can start comparing tickets. In Haystack 2.0 retrievers are tightly coupled to DocumentStores. If we pass the document store in the retriever we initialized earlier, this pipeline can access the documents we generated, and pass them to the reranker. The reranker then compares these documents directly with the question and ranks them based on relevance.



We first define the custom cleaner to remove retrieve tickets that contain either the same issue ID or parent ID as the issue passed as query:



from typing import Optional



@component


class RemoveRelated:


    @component.output_types(documents=List[Document])
    def run(self, tickets: List[Document], query_id: Optional[str]):
        retrieved_tickets = []
        for t in tickets:
            if not t.meta['Issue id'] == query_id and not t.meta['Parent id'] == query_id:
                retrieved_tickets.append(t)
        return {'documents': retrieved_tickets}


We then embed the query, retrieve relevant documents, clean the selection, and finally rerank it:



from haystack_integrations.components.embedders.jina import JinaTextEmbedder


from haystack_integrations.components.rankers.jina import JinaRanker



query_pipeline_reranker = Pipeline()


query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_embedder_reranker', JinaTextEmbedder(model='jina-embeddings-v2-base-en'))


query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_retriever_reranker', retriever_reranker)


query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_cleaner_reranker', RemoveRelated())


query_pipeline_reranker.add_component('query_ranker_reranker', JinaRanker())



query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_embedder_reranker.embedding', 'query_retriever_reranker.query_embedding')


query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_retriever_reranker', 'query_cleaner_reranker')


query_pipeline_reranker.connect('query_cleaner_reranker', 'query_ranker_reranker')




To highlight the difference caused by the reranker, we analyzed the same pipeline without the final reranking step (the corresponding code was omitted in this post for the sake of readability but can be found in the notebook):



To compare the results of these two pipelines, we now define our query in the form of an existing ticket, here "ZOOKEEPER-3282":



query_ticket_key = 'ZOOKEEPER-3282'



with open('tickets.json', 'r') as file:


    tickets = json.load(file)


for ticket in tickets:


    if ticket['Issue key'] == query_ticket_key:
        query = str(ticket)
        query_ticket_id = ticket['Issue id']


It concerns "a big refactor for the documetations" [sic]. You'll see that, despite the misspelling, Jina Reranker will correctly retrieve similar tickets.

}




Finally, we run the query pipeline. In this case, it retrieves 20 tickets, eliminates ID-related entries, reranks them, and outputs the final selection of the 10 most relevant issues.



Before the reranking step, the output includes 17 tickets:



Rank	Issue ID	Issue Key	Summary


1	13191544	ZOOKEEPER-3170	Umbrella for eliminating ZooKeeper flaky tests


2	13400622	ZOOKEEPER-4375	Quota cannot limit the specify value when multiply clients create/set znodes

17	12478629	ZOOKEEPER-915	Errors that happen during sync() processing at the leader do not get propagated back to the client.



After including the reranker, we now run the query pipeline:



result = query_pipeline_reranker.run(data={'query_embedder_reranker':{'text': query},


                                  'query_retriever_reranker': {'top_k': 20},
                                  'query_cleaner_reranker': {'query_id': query_ticket_id},
                                  'query_ranker_reranker': {'query': query, 'top_k': 10}
                                  }
                            )


for idx, res in enumerate(result['query_ranker_reranker']['documents']):


    print('Doc {}:'.format(idx + 1), res)


The final output is the 10 most relevant tickets:



Rank	Issue ID	Issue Key	Summary


1	13262989	ZOOKEEPER-3587	Add a documentation about docker


2	13265507	ZOOKEEPER-3600	support the complete linearizable read and multiply read consistency level

10	13222060	ZOOKEEPER-3318	[CLI way]Add a complete backup mechanism for zookeeper internal


Advantages of Jina Embeddings and Reranker



To sum up this tutorial, we built a duplicate-ticket identification tool based on Jina Embeddings, Jina Reranker and Haystack 2.0. The results above clearly show the necessity for both Jina Embeddings to retrieve relevant documents through vector search, and Jina Reranker to finally obtain the most relevant content.



If we take, for example, the two issues that relate to adding documentation, i.e. "ZOOKEEPER-3585" and "ZOOKEEPER-3587", we see that after the retrieval step, they are both correctly included in positions 11 and 9 respectively. After reranking the documents, they are now both within the top 5 most relevant documents at positions 5 and 1 respectively, showing a significant improvement.



By integrating both models in Haystack's pipelines, the entire tool is ready for use. This combination makes the Jina Haystack extension the perfect solution for your application.
