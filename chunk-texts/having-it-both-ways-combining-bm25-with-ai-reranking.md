#### 2 chunk(s)

Jina Reranker adds a deeper level of understanding to traditional search technologies. Algorithms like BM25 do a good job of retrieving documents based on term frequency but struggle to evaluate the meaning of the texts they retrieve in light of the user's intent. This is where AI excels: Reranker helps produce outcomes that are better aligned with what users are looking for. Therefore, for businesses that want to bring the powerful advantages of AI models to their search frameworks, adding Jina Reranker can be a wise decision and doesn't incur the burdens of replacing an existing search infrastructure. Itâ€™s about refining search results to make them not just acceptable, but exceptional: more relevant and more accurate. Why Jina Reranker? Among reranker models, Jina Reranker models stand out as frontrunners with state-of-the-art scores on performance benchmarks. Maximizing Search Relevance and RAG Accuracy with Jina Reranker Boost your search and RAG accuracy with Jina Reranker. Our new model improves the accuracy and relevance by 20% over simple vector search. Try it now for free!

Here's an overview of how this integration improves the search experience: Boosted Hit Rates: The fusion of Jina Reranker and traditional search has notably increased the frequency of relevant results. This makes the search process more accurate, aligning closely with user queries. Improved User Experience: There's a tangible improvement in the quality of search results. This indicates that the combined capabilities of Jina Reranker and BM25 are better aligned with users' specific needs, enhancing their overall search experience. High Precision for Complex Queries: When it comes to difficult searches, this synergy ensures a more detailed understanding of both the query and related content. This translates to sharper, more accurate results. Ready to Elevate Your Search Experience? Jina Reranker is your ideal solution for increasing the relevance of your search results.

Retrieval-Agnostic Neural Reranking Reranker is agroundbreaking addition to the search system landscape. Designed to enhance the value of existing search engines such as Elasticsearch, it serves as an extra layer, working like an add-on to refine the delivered search quality.

A query passes through BM25 and the retrieved documents are refined by Jina Reranker. Let's walk through a practical e-commerce example to demonstrate Jina Reranker's impact in real-world applications. The goal here is to search product listings based on a user's query. To illustrate this, we'll set up two search pipelines using the popular AI search and orchestration framework Haystack by deepset. The first pipeline uses BM25 by itself. The second one integrates jina-reranker-v1-base-en into the BM25 system. You can easily replace Haystack's InMemoryDocumentStore component with ElasticsearchDocumentStore to do the same experiment if you have an existing Elasticsearch cluster. We'll use a sample dataset from Kaggle. You can directly download the CSV here. This side-by-side comparison showcases the enhancements brought by incorporating Jina Reranker into the search workflow. To start, install all the necessary components: pip install --q haystack-ai jina-haystack Set the Jina API Key as an environment variable. You can generate one here. import os import getpass os.environ["JINA_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass() Query for a product based on product names. For example: short_query = "Nightwear for Women" Transform each CSV row into a Document: import csv from haystack import Document documents = [] with open("fashion_data.csv") as f: data = csv.reader(f, delimiter=";") for row in data: row_text = ''.join(row) row_doc = Document(content=row_text, meta={"prod_id": row[0], "prod_image": row[1]}) documents.append(row_doc) Pipeline #1: BM25 Only from haystack import Pipeline from haystack.document_stores.types import DuplicatePolicy from haystack.document_stores.in_memory import InMemoryDocumentStore from haystack.components.retrievers.in_memory import InMemoryBM25Retriever document_store=InMemoryDocumentStore() document_store.write_documents(documents=documents, policy=DuplicatePolicy.OVERWRITE) retriever = InMemoryBM25Retriever(document_store=document_store) rag_pipeline = Pipeline() rag_pipeline.add_component("retriever", retriever) result = rag_pipeline.run( { "retriever": {"query": query, "top_k": 50}, } ) for doc in result["retriever"]["documents"]: print("Product ID:", doc.meta["prod_id"]) print("Product Image:", doc.meta["prod_image"]) print("Score:", doc.score) print("-"*100) Here are thumbnails of the 50 results returned by BM25:

We can see that the results are related to nightwear, partially matching the query, but the most relevant matches (emboldened images in the grid above) seem to get lost within the multitude of products retrieved by BM25.

In practice, using just BM25 means that a user would receive mainly unrelated results at the top of the page. Pipeline #2: BM25 + Jina Reranker The script below outlines how to construct this pipeline step-by-step: from haystack_integrations.components.rankers.jina import JinaRanker ranker_retriever = InMemoryBM25Retriever(document_store=document_store) ranker = JinaRanker() ranker_pipeline = Pipeline() ranker_pipeline.add_component("ranker_retriever", ranker_retriever) ranker_pipeline.add_component("ranker", ranker) ranker_pipeline.connect("ranker_retriever.documents", "ranker.documents") result = ranker_pipeline.run( { "ranker_retriever": {"query": query, "top_k": 50}, "ranker": {"query": query, "top_k": 10}, } ) for doc in result["ranker"]["documents"]: print("Product ID:", doc.meta["prod_id"]) print("Product Image:", doc.meta["prod_image"]) print("Score:", doc.score) print("-"*100) Here are the top 10 results returned by Jina Reranker: Compared to BM25, Jina Reranker returns a much more relevant collection of answers.

You can follow along in Colab or by downloading the notebook.


Add Jina Reranker to Your Existing Workflow:



Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the updated workflow integrating Jina Reranker:

See It in Action: Enhancing E-Commerce Search with Jina Reranker


A query passes through BM25 and the retrieved documents are refined by Jina Reranker.



Let's walk through a practical e-commerce example to demonstrate Jina Reranker's impact in real-world applications. The goal here is to search product listings based on a user's query.



To illustrate this, we'll set up two search pipelines using the popular AI search and orchestration framework Haystack by deepset. The first pipeline uses BM25 by itself. The second one integrates jina-reranker-v1-base-en into the BM25 system. You can easily replace Haystack's InMemoryDocumentStore component with ElasticsearchDocumentStore to do the same experiment if you have an existing Elasticsearch cluster.



We'll use a sample dataset from Kaggle. You can directly download the CSV here. This side-by-side comparison showcases the enhancements brought by incorporating Jina Reranker into the search workflow.



To start, install all the necessary components:



pip install --q haystack-ai jina-haystack




Set the Jina API Key as an environment variable. You can generate one here.



import os


import getpass



os.environ["JINA_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()




Query for a product based on product names. For example:



short_query = "Nightwear for Women"




Transform each CSV row into a Document:



import csv


from haystack import Document



documents = []


with open("fashion_data.csv") as f:


    data = csv.reader(f, delimiter=";")
    for row in data:
      row_text = ''.join(row)
      row_doc = Document(content=row_text, meta={"prod_id": row[0], "prod_image": row[1]})
      documents.append(row_doc)

    print("Product ID:", doc.meta["prod_id"])

In practice, using just BM25 means that a user would receive mainly unrelated results at the top of the page.



Pipeline #2: BM25 + Jina Reranker



The script below outlines how to construct this pipeline step-by-step:

ranker_retriever = InMemoryBM25Retriever(document_store=document_store)



ranker = JinaRanker()



ranker_pipeline = Pipeline()


ranker_pipeline.add_component("ranker_retriever", ranker_retriever)

    print("Product ID:", doc.meta["prod_id"])
    print("Product Image:", doc.meta["prod_image"])
    print("Score:", doc.score)
    print("-"*100)


Here are the top 10 results returned by Jina Reranker:



Compared to BM25, Jina Reranker returns a much more relevant collection of answers. In our e-commerce setting, this translates to a better user experience and increased likelihood of purchases.



Impact of Integrating Jina Reranker with BM25
