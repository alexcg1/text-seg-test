The startup ecosystem thrives on disruption and innovation. The vision of a dedicated vector store is alluring, promising unparalleled performance and capabilities. But in the world of startups, vision needs to be backed by tangible benefits. The reality is that while vector stores offer a new approach, tools like Lucene have been refining their capabilities for years. For startups, the challenge is to prove that their solutions offer not just incremental improvements but transformative changes.

Do You Truly Need a Dedicated Vector Store?


Unraveling vector search spaghetti: Lucene's charm vs. shiny vector stores. Navigating enterprise mazes & startup vibes. Where's search headed next?


Han Xiao • 4 minutes read



In the rapidly shifting landscape of technology, it's all too easy to be ensnared by the latest buzzwords and narratives. One such prevailing discourse is the perceived necessity for a dedicated "vector store" or "vector database" in the modern AI stack. This notion is propelled by the increasing application of deep neural networks to search, leading many to believe that managing a vast number of dense vectors demands a specialized store. But is this narrative grounded in reality?



Drawing from the insights of the paper "Vector Search with OpenAI Embeddings: Lucene Is All You Need" by Jimmy Lin etc., and enriched by the collective wisdom of the tech community, let's dissect this debate.

Lucene's Role in Modern Vector Search



Lucene, renowned for its inverted index-based search, has long been a cornerstone in the search realm. Critics argue its limitations, particularly in contextual search with fuzzy logic like min edit distance. Yet, Lucene is far from stagnant. As described in the paper, the advent of hierarchical navigable small-world network (HNSW) indexes showcases Lucene's adaptability, proving its prowess in vector search capabilities on par with any dedicated vector store.



A standard bi-encoder architecture used in Jimmy's paper, where encoders generate dense vector representations (embeddings) from queries and documents (passages). Retrieval is framed as k-nearest neighbor search in vector space.



It's not just Lucene making waves. Vector indices are now industry staples. Giants like ElasticSearch, Postgresql, and Redis are embracing this trend. Google's recent endorsement of pgvector for their AlloyDB offering underscores the mainstream shift towards vector search.

Enterprise Search Challenges: Navigating the Vector Store Maze



Modern enterprise architectures are intricate tapestries of legacy systems, cutting-edge solutions, and a myriad of tools aimed at solving specific problems. The introduction of a dedicated vector store would not just be a simple addition; it would be a paradigm shift. Historically, enterprises have shown a tendency to lean on tried-and-tested solutions, especially when significant investments have been made. Lucene-based platforms, with their proven track record, offer a sense of reliability. The challenge for enterprises is not just about technology but also about change management, training, and integration. The real question is: Is the potential performance gain worth the upheaval?

Startup Innovations: Beyond the Vector Store Hype



The startup ecosystem thrives on disruption and innovation. The vision of a dedicated vector store is alluring, promising unparalleled performance and capabilities. But in the world of startups, vision needs to be backed by tangible benefits. The reality is that while vector stores offer a new approach, tools like Lucene have been refining their capabilities for years. For startups, the challenge is to prove that their solutions offer not just incremental improvements but transformative changes. In a data-driven world, the onus is on these startups to showcase empirical evidence of their superiority, not just in lab conditions but in real-world scenarios.
