Miruna Nedelcu • 3 minutes read Client Overview Ourclient, a leading European e-commerce platform, specializing in fashion and lifestyle, offers a wide range of clothing, footwear, and accessories. Their platform features an extensive selection of emerging and well-known brands, with a total of around two million product images, spanning all their product categories. The client's vision was clear: automatically generate basic and specific descriptions for all these images and, more importantly, categorize them with detailed tags to improve user experience and enhance search result quality. Why They Started Looking For A New Solution "We were facing significant challenges in managing our vast catalog of product images. Manual image description generation was too time-consuming. We needed a solution to save time and resources and provide comprehensive product tagging. SceneXplain was the game-changer that helped us achieve this." - Sales Director 1. Efficiently Generating Descriptions: With two million images to manage, creating descriptions for each one manually was a time–consuming and inefficient task. It took roughly a week for them to write descriptions for the first seven thousand images. The client sought an automated solution to save valuable time and resources. 2. Better Product Tagging: They wanted a comprehensive tagging system that went beyond general descriptions. They needed to categorize products by attributes such as color, gender, and more, all while maintaining a consistent schema for easy management.
